{"sentence":"I do not accept it .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this House has to ensure that in those countries where we give aid we monitor the breakdown of law and order and look at the interests of those ethnic minorities who are in danger .","label":0}
{"sentence":"it would , therefore , be irresponsible of Parliament to adopt amendments which could not be accepted by the Council .","label":0}

{"sentence":"this is why this topic needs special attention .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we as a Parliament would have preferred to have our demand taken effect that \" essential \" is at least 90 % , as that would have meant that the Parliament 's demand was met , and there would be no longer any financial incentive to continue to dump shipwrecks into the sea .","label":1}

{"sentence":"I think these are examples that we should also promote .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I want to remind him \u2013 and he cautiously skirted around this in his answer \u2013 that we are discussing an archaic piece of legislation .","label":0}

{"sentence":"the Common Foreign and Security Policy is one of the policies of the European Union that is almost completely undeveloped .","label":1}
{"sentence":"do I already kill there ?","label":1}
{"sentence":"the poorer countries were there with very few .","label":0}
{"sentence":"even those who are interested in and committed to change have not been imbued with a sense of urgency or , crucially , Mr President , a feeling of ownership of reform .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we need therefore access to networks and other system facilities that is completely transparent and free of discrimination for all market participants , as otherwise there will be distortions of competition .","label":1}
{"sentence":"it also concerned the question of whether exemptions should be made from the obligation to tender .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we have imposed sanctions that do not affect the population .","label":1}

{"sentence":"we all know that these provisions present a lot of problems today .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Mr Commissioner , I appreciate your statement .","label":1}
{"sentence":"however , I would like to add that something must also change in the Member States , because the environment ministers are sometimes too shy to advocate the ideas they decide here in their countries , if this could cause conflicts .","label":1}
{"sentence":"there is a real problem in obtaining money for clinical trials .","label":0}
{"sentence":"it destroyed a large part of the post-war reconstruction , new housing , took everything from young entrepreneurs - they are owed generations - and destroyed the newly renovated city center almost completely , really badly .","label":1}
{"sentence":"it will also be a new fact for all the citizens of the Member States that their currency is valid in such a wider area and is also the leading currency beyond Europe .","label":1}
{"sentence":"this is a very encouraging step .","label":1}
{"sentence":"at the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the whole process will take time .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the main aim of the announcement is to strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy in the sense of the Lisbon Strategy Decisions .","label":1}

{"sentence":"we wanted to make it legally clear that a wider spread is possible and that aircraft are to be charged either by certification or by actual measured noise levels .","label":1}
{"sentence":"when we reflect on this again - what is the amount of the European budget and what is the slight increase that is now being provided for by the expansion - I must say that the dispute that is being driven is not entirely justified , and there is a danger that we will become very stuck in financial issues and maybe even bite ourselves .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I turn to the discussion on how we view this matter \u2013 whether with complacency , or pessimism , or optimism etc .","label":0}
{"sentence":"well , how then do reputable companies perform transparent audits on equal pay for equal work ?","label":0}

{"sentence":"I ask you , Mr. Prodi , to stand up to your promises and to implement them !","label":1}
{"sentence":"so , Mr Bouwman , I cannot agree with your proposal 9 . in our resolution point 14 , we expect that in a directive , the four EEVC tests should be used as a standard or other methods that provide at least the same or even better protection .","label":1}
{"sentence":"let us turn those tools against them .","label":0}
{"sentence":"thank you to the Spanish Presidency of the Council , who has now worked very constructively with me to come to a solution that makes an arbitration procedure unnecessary , and of course also to the Commission and to you , Mr Commissioner Bolkestein .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we as the European Union want to cooperate with Laos .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we heard from Commissioner Byrne that the EU has made its own estimate .","label":0}

{"sentence":"now it is urgent to decide whether to promote shipbuilding in Europe and thus to preserve the whole maritime industry or to leave this high-tech industry to others .","label":1}
{"sentence":"but in general it is not a health and safety agenda .","label":0}

{"sentence":"she is really very obstinate , because we had a very good report already in the second reading , but she wanted to push through some amendments , and I must congratulate her .","label":1}
{"sentence":"it seems strange to me , however , that within this reform process two areas are not being touched upon .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I don 't see why in a development stage where only technical aspects are to be discussed , the Member States should be consulted and involved in every detail .","label":1}
{"sentence":"it is not surprising in the context of this contrast that 88 % of people in the United Kingdom in a massive recent poll indicated that they wanted to have a say in a referendum on these proposals .","label":0}
{"sentence":"a last comment on the European Constitution , because we talked about it this morning :","label":1}

{"sentence":"speaking as somebody who during the course of a fairly long and not , I hope , entirely misspent political life , has sat under a number of chairmen , I do not think I have ever sat under a chairman who was better , more competent , more decisive or more courteous than the Prime Minister of Portugal .","label":0}

{"sentence":"these existing protection clauses remain in force and are applied , of course .","label":1}

{"sentence":"may I ask you therefore to write on behalf of the European Parliament to all those involved and congratulate them on this major initiative ?","label":0}

{"sentence":"the rapporteur says there is no immediate prospect of therapies being available to patients ; if he gets this restrictive deadline reinstated , he may be right .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Commissioner Lamy talks about certain agricultural products , but it has been precisely the protectionism of the common agricultural policy that has most offended developing countries and which has held back development for many of those countries in terms of agricultural production .","label":0}
{"sentence":"these analyses clearly enhance our understanding of euro area developments .","label":0}

{"sentence":"I think that will lead to the industry thinking again about whether to use genetic engineering , because the consumers in large majority don 't want these products .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the reason I gave so much information \u2013 like you I had access to this information \u2013 was that it could be an attempt by a private company or by groups of private companies to distort the market before the full impact of European Union law becomes legal and to interfere so that no action can be taken afterwards .","label":0}
{"sentence":"if we think that efficiency and democracy are incompatible , that flexibility and responsible parliamentary participation are incompatible , that transparency and responsible parliamentary participation are incompatible , then that is actually a shame on us , I think .","label":1}
{"sentence":"you said right that there is a time constraint , and we need to work hard so that the projects can start and the affected people can get their appropriate funds .","label":1}

{"sentence":"Mr President , my dear colleagues , my dear colleagues !","label":1}
{"sentence":"that is a measure that was introduced in the legislation in ease of the kind of farming that I know exists in some remote areas in Scotland and , to a very large extent , meets the case that you have put forward in trying to respond to the concerns that you address .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the solution permits a temporary relaxation of the ban on the use of catering waste in feed for some Member States , under certain highly controlled conditions to be established by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the amendments proposed by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca tomorrow are in this sense ineffective and should be rejected .","label":1}
{"sentence":"by nature they tend to be secretive .","label":0}
{"sentence":"in the area of Justice and Home Affairs , I commend the President-in-Office for the progress made thus far under Greece 's stewardship .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this is done as a cost-sharing between the Community and the carriers on 1 January 2004 .","label":1}
{"sentence":"first : there is no planning certainty for the financing of the extension beyond 2006 .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the Commission has been implementing measures since May of last year to tackle this problem .","label":0}
{"sentence":"further to the amendment to the 2004 draft budget tabled in this House , and placing in reserve the appropriations under three of the budget headings related to the activities of DG Press , the Commission was given the task of trying to reach an accommodation that , as far as possible , satisfied the demands for operational continuity sought by Parliament , whilst also securing financial monitoring and control .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this should also be stressed because the European budget is often accused of not promoting new developments by its particular focus on agriculture .","label":1}
{"sentence":"to leave things as they are at present , with 15 competing national jurisdictions , will be a cause of confusion and future problems .","label":0}
{"sentence":"secondly : NATO should be gradually dissolved and not expanded to the east .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Europe and the United States work closely together in defence of the values we share .","label":0}

{"sentence":"however , there is a problem in redeveloping Kosovo 's trade .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I think the European Union and the United States bear a tremendous responsibility for the future definition of trade policy .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the council must still approve .","label":1}
{"sentence":"let us take the example of the Marrakech Agreements on agriculture .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the measure proposed will allow European securities and insurance regulators to exchange , on a cross-sectoral basis , confidential supervisory information with third country competent authorities .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we are most appreciative of that work and of her report because it concerns a matter which is of importance , not so much to governments , but in particular to the private citizens of the European Union , as Mrs Randzio-Plath said a little while ago .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the question which people are now asking is whether NATO is really capable of acting and whether it will be really effective once it has more central and eastern European countries ?","label":0}
{"sentence":"we met the former opposition leader who is now the prime minister .","label":1}
{"sentence":"so the question arises , who should monitor the compliance of the self-commitments and what measures should be taken against non-compliance .","label":1}
{"sentence":"that is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this cooperation will also be very important for the stability and security , the second priority , which was also mentioned .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Copenhagen 1993 meant dignity , meant justice , meant democracy , meant recognition of minorities , meant market economy .","label":1}

{"sentence":"I think we should make sure that doesn 't happen again .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Madam President , I wish to begin by thanking Members for their interest in this proposal and especially Mrs Ries , the rapporteur , for her constructive work , as well as the delegation of the European Parliament in the Conciliation Committee .","label":0}
{"sentence":"applications must be for a project starting from July 1 , 2003 to December 1 , 2003 and ending by June 30 , 2004 .","label":1}
{"sentence":"it 's just as American as it is European .","label":1}
{"sentence":"today we stand before the great expansion of the European Union .","label":1}
{"sentence":"without taking into account the devastating effects on diesel technology , it is also proposed to raise the tax rate for diesel to the level of unfiltered gasoline .","label":1}
{"sentence":"hopefully those problems will be solved and we should not be in that situation for next year .","label":0}
{"sentence":"so whilst it is important that we stress the importance of the United States agreement , we should remember that this is a report about relations with other countries , not just the United States .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we ask you to give us as soon as possible a very substantial report , so that we can discuss with you and with the Council what should be further handled .","label":1}
{"sentence":"in this context the Union is undertaking significant mediation and dialogue promotion efforts at the different levels of the conflict and the Commission is ready to contribute to the success of the Lusaka ceasefire agreement in the following areas .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the problem is the lack of coordination within the Council and also within the governments of the Member States .","label":1}

{"sentence":"the farmers cannot control what the contents are .","label":1}
{"sentence":"our European agricultural model could be a model in its multifunctionality with all its peculiarities and its importance for society .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I hope that the terrorist attacks of September 11 have awakened the Council , which means the Interior and Justice Ministers , as well as the Presidents of the States and Governments , to see that national resentments and animosity are not at the root of the international terrorism .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Mr Lannoye knows he has my respect , but I have to say with some regret that I fear we are repeating some of the debating errors of the chocolate directive and the determination to rechristen some products .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Mr President !","label":1}
{"sentence":"you know that the Commission sent a recovery order .","label":1}
{"sentence":"confirmation from the Commissioner that the new regulation on these limits will definitively be in place by 1 January 2003 would be of great comfort .","label":0}
{"sentence":"so we also advocate that it should be a binding goal , and it should start in the country where the efficiency is the highest and where the improvement is the most significant .","label":1}
{"sentence":"in road and rail traffic , the proposed concepts and plans are much faster to implement to achieve real improvements .","label":1}
{"sentence":"but once this report is voted on today , Parliament will stand ready to negotiate with the Commission and the Council a code which will cause citizens to blink in the bright Strasbourg sunshine .","label":0}
{"sentence":"more seriously , I sit here as a representative of Scotland in the European Parliament , and we have had the opportunity to debate and vote on the substance of the issue of the Iraq emergency .","label":0}
{"sentence":"events in Toulouse and in Enschede have demonstrated the need for action to amend and reinforce the existing Directive , so as to avoid any possibility of accidents and to minimise damage should an accident occur .","label":0}
{"sentence":"as I mentioned earlier , this proposal is closely related to the proposal for a directive on national emission ceilings where conciliation negotiations are currently under way and we have to recognise the difficulty of finding a solution for linked issues , for example the target values for ozone , in the absence of a definitive outcome .","label":0}
{"sentence":"author of the opinion of the joint committee on budget . \u2013 Mr President , dear colleagues !","label":1}

{"sentence":"the Commission is keen to discuss with Member States how the European Union should respond to these disturbing findings and on how we should react to Professor Bandashevsky 's imprisonment , taking account of the strong views that are felt by honourable Members .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong , honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner ; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels ; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential .","label":0}
