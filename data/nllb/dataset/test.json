{"sentence":"the population is concerned because there is evidence of a link between this enriched uranium in the munitions and its health and environmental effects .","label":1}

{"sentence":"we must go on reiterating the point that trying to do so much damage , putting such a tough squeeze on the Palestinian territories , is not to restore security or the way to lay the foundations for a future in which both parties can live happily and amicably together .","label":0}
{"sentence":"what the Commission said :","label":1}
{"sentence":"\" I think that is also our position , and that should be taken into account at this summit .","label":1}
{"sentence":"because it is only from this environment that they draw strength for their important tasks for society .","label":1}
{"sentence":"this agreement is , if you will , the door-opener for OLAF .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the Hungarian Government is gratefully making efforts to do so , and the Romanian and Slovak Governments are also willing to participate .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we should therefore be more generous with transitional rules in order not to put too much pressure on the economy .","label":1}
{"sentence":"so , just as the previous report called for common European standards on asylum , we are absolutely right to be calling for common European standards for the victims of crime and access to legal aid .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we call on the Council not to block Europol 's counterterrorism financing from EU budget until such a constitutional treaty is adopted by the Intergovernmental Conference .","label":1}
{"sentence":"so it is not about releasing GMOs , but about defining another quality standard for the marketing of conventional seeds .","label":1}
{"sentence":"as far as I know , the European Economic Interest Group is currently a structure which lacks defined programmatic content .","label":0}
{"sentence":"that seems to me to offer some lessons for the Barcelona Summit next year : if we want to push forward the economic reform agenda in this sector and in others , we need to continue to rely on the tried and tested Community method and not resort to the intergovernmentalism that frankly was implicit in much of what the Council seemed to suggest in the negotiation positions it took on this package .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we wanted to maintain national antitrust rules and rules against unfair competition , but we went one step further .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the Commission shows respect all around but is bound by the formalities of the Treaty and wishes its words to be interpreted in that way .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the Inglewood Report and the simplification and transparency it has introduced are therefore a good contribution to a better understanding of the situation for citizens and thus a contribution to a vibrant single market .","label":1}

{"sentence":"I think there are misunderstandings here , for example , with regard to the database .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the discussion of the 2005 budget could coincide with the debate on the next financial planning for the period after 2006 .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we are fulfilling the mandate of Amsterdam and Nice .","label":1}
{"sentence":"it is quite obvious , of course , that small countries like Ireland , Belgium and Luxembourg need free trade , but a European Union with a single market or a North American single market is an entirely different proposition .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the Commission has therefore decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the measures taken are not inadequate .","label":1}
{"sentence":"it is not always easy .","label":0}
{"sentence":"so we call for sustainable environmental protection , social standards and the prevention of human rights violations .","label":1}
{"sentence":"worse still , in an astonishing and utterly cynical reversal of perspective , the French version of the justification refers to the deterioration in the Yugoslav economy due to the \u2018 war against NATO in 1999 \u2019 .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I have personally made several attempts to speed up this process in the Council and in the Member States .","label":1}

{"sentence":"we therefore support the creation of an effective Union security and defence policy with its own identity .","label":1}
{"sentence":"that sounds good , paper is patient , and it would be fine if we were angels .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we are also pleased that the difficult issue of catering waste has finally been resolved .","label":0}
{"sentence":"why , then , is this effort , some will ridiculously ask themselves .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Mr President , I want to speak to you .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we also expect a flawless trial for the arrested Krishna Sen , a key guerrilla leader , and four other alleged members of the banned Communist Party .","label":1}
{"sentence":"last , but not least , the general regime does not offer provisions which are crucial in the car sector to ensure benefits for the consumer .","label":0}
{"sentence":"but if the Commission is so inconsistent on this point , it is our constitutional duty .","label":1}
{"sentence":"by tying the two together \u2013 salary and expenses \u2013 we are avoiding the fact that the system needs to be changed .","label":0}
{"sentence":"touching upon the Galileo project , we need to maximise the use of the private sector .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I know you mean the illegal drugs .","label":1}
{"sentence":"what are we gonna do ?","label":1}

{"sentence":"if we don 't win the Council , we 'll be left alone !","label":1}
{"sentence":"the candidate countries must implement the full range of EU directives and regulations .","label":0}
{"sentence":"so I ask you :","label":1}
{"sentence":"the preservation of universal service must therefore ensure the inclusive nature of this society .","label":0}

{"sentence":"you are right to proceed with our business and I would appeal to the staff of the House to assist us in carrying through today 's historic task with the maximum goodwill on their part .","label":0}
{"sentence":"that wasn 't enough .","label":1}

{"sentence":"I beg you , act !","label":1}
{"sentence":"let me now answer a few points that were raised this evening .","label":0}
{"sentence":"as you , Mrs Sudre , as a representative of the outermost regions rightly call for solidarity , I also ask for your solidarity with the interests of Objective 1 regions , in the sense that no cuts in the budget can be made while there are still disadvantages compared to the developed regions of Europe .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster , a significant portion of which falls within Ireland \u2019 s only Objective I region .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I appreciate your commitment to help in conveying the importance of combating climate change throughout Europe and to your counterparts in other countries , in particular the United States Congress .","label":0}
{"sentence":"in some cases , such criticism is also directed at governments .","label":1}
{"sentence":"but above all , the division of the Commissioners into those with and without the right to vote is a real structural error , even where the Commission remains a collective body .","label":1}
{"sentence":"in another case earlier this year we considered a petition from a British citizen , on behalf of 40,000 British pensioners living in Spain , who complained that the British Government was refusing to pay them the winter fuel allowance .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Mr President , I want to echo Mr Harbour 's congratulations to Mr Belder .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this is democracy and subsidiarity .","label":1}

{"sentence":"but actually to be disbanded because it is a waste of money .","label":0}
{"sentence":"in fact the Commission has already started or planned several initiatives to respond to these requirements .","label":0}
{"sentence":"beyond that , the EU is a major contributor to international security in a host of different contexts : through , for example , our contribution to global trade .","label":0}
{"sentence":"my group is offering a compromise on this question .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I hope that those who have set up this procedural circle will receive a receipt from the voters .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we condemn all forms of extremism , of course , but we need to know the exact background .","label":1}
{"sentence":"unless we address that question then the whole issue of a Common Foreign and Security Policy and a European defence identity is no more than a day-dream .","label":0}
{"sentence":"with regard to a proposal for four industry representatives on the board , it would be helpful for the Commission to clarify that the various sectors of the maritime industry would be represented .","label":0}
{"sentence":"so , precaution is required here .","label":1}
{"sentence":"there are frequently issues which emerge not only from a complaint or , in some cases , from a petition to the Petitions Committee , but there are more general points which need to be looked at .","label":0}
{"sentence":"it will be many more if there is any slippage in that timetable , because any country that has not signed its accession treaty by the beginning of 2004 , but comes in during the next Parliament , will have its MEPs added on top of the 732 .","label":0}
{"sentence":"no 1408 \/ 71 \u2019 .","label":0}
{"sentence":"currently , the opportunity to prepare a further common position on the suggestions tabled is being explored .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Mr President , I would like to ask you a question which has nothing to do with the Guinness Book of Records but which is probably the longest immunity withdrawal procedure in the world .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the decision in relation to the Netherlands provides for suppressive vaccination .","label":0}
{"sentence":"but this sounds more dramatic than it is , because these 10 together represent about 75 million citizens , while all 13 candidates together are at least 185 million .","label":1}
{"sentence":"if we give back billions of euros to the Member States because we are unable to use up programmes , it is not because we are particularly sparing , but simply because we lack the implementation of the policies we have agreed on .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we will not accept any more facts and circumstances that we have not been asked to do .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I am sure this is of interest to a number of Members and there will be a few Members who want to look at it .","label":0}
{"sentence":"officials have experienced frustration and difficulty over this , not only in Britain but indeed in most EU Member States .","label":0}
{"sentence":"DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the European Central Bank is in a different situation than the American Central Bank .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I would like to thank you very much , Mr President .","label":1}

{"sentence":"the Commission 's recent report has already said the growth of the aviation sector is unsustainable and must be reversed and that growth is forecast to double in the next 15 years .","label":0}
{"sentence":"it is time that we restored some perspective to this and stopped undermining the work of our regulatory bodies .","label":0}
{"sentence":"in view of this growing interest , the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle .","label":0}
