212,"yes , we need more support for small and medium-sized enterprises ."

217,we are calling for more Europe when it comes to achieving the Lisbon objectives and thu

533,together we are on the right path .
534,"the goal is known , but we still have a lot of steps to take ."

537,I am a fervent supporter of the principle of subsidiarity and come from a country which
538,I would also like to call on all Member States not to use the principle of subsidiarity

739,I think that Parliament 's delegation to the Conciliation Committee fought very hard and
740,"nevertheless , we cannot be satisfied with the outcome of the conciliation"
741,the European Parliament wanted a binding directive rather than nice recommendations .
742,the Member States have blocked the process and they also have to take responsibility for the fact
743,we also had different positions among those involved in this legislative process .
744,the Council originally did not want to include any regulation in the directive and left this to

750,the results of the Pisa study in Germany are sobering .
751,"I therefore advocate a reform of school policy , which must also take into account the views"
752,I think that the participation of young people in public life is particularly important .
753,young people are increasingly less involved in traditional organizational structures such as parties and trade union
754,this is particularly evident in the turnout of young people at national and European level .
755,"we must encourage young people in particular to run for local , national and European offices and we"
756,I demand that the voice and opinion of young people in politics is not dismissed as a

761,"if you take an initiative in this regard , you will have our full support ."
762,"Mr President of the Commission , you have repeatedly represented and defended the European Parliament"

764,"we expressly pay you our respect , our recognition and our support for this , including for"
765,"in assessing the in-depth comments on the Green Paper , we would like the Commission"

774,the reunification of Europe is an opportunity of historic significance .
775,it is based on a community of law and reconciliation among the peoples of Europe .

797,this is an area in which Parliament has taken a great deal of initiatives through its Committee

799,"Mr President , I would just like to say that this is a dangerous precedent ."
800,one can request that the report be dealt with without debate beforehand if it is not controvers
801,I wish the Presidency all the best in its negotiations in this regard .
802,the European Parliament will certainly support this approach more or less unanimously in its resolution .

816,"there must be something wrong with the system if , at the end of 1999"

821,"this is a violation of the EC Treaty , which requires such independent financial control ."

832,the Commission expects the Turkish Government to address this incident without delay .
833,this incident shows that political reforms in Turkey are urgently needed if Turkey is to move close
834,the Commission recalls that the full protection of human rights is one of the political criteria
835,"this is also reflected in the priorities of the Accession Partnership with Turkey , which"
836,I thought this was very important .
837,"I have not been in the areas , I have only been on the phone , but many people"
838,this very personal human presence on the spot has been of great value to all of us .
839,"I have been in contact with President Prodi in recent days and , on behalf of our"
840,we in Parliament intend to amend the supplementary and amending budget in such a way
841,we have just heard that there are payment requirements in many areas to meet past commitments .
842,we will be very keen to discuss this with the Council in the coming days and weeks .
843,we will be paying close attention to how open and open-minded the Council is with

845,everyone must know that cooperation means that everyone is willing to talk to each other .
846,"this is also the case in connection with the supplementary and amending budget , as always in"
847,"we are ready , but we are also ready to discuss with each other very intensively and ,"
848,I came directly here to Strasbourg last night from a visit to Israel .
849,maybe my statements are somewhat influenced by my private connections .
850,"but believe me , this people wants peace on both sides ."
851,it is part of our task to be able to talk to both sides .
852,it does not always have to be exclusively the politicians who are now active .
853,"we agree with the resolution of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , where"
854,"Nice has of course both bright and dark sides , but very many shadow sides ."
855,but our benchmark for Nice has always been the European Union 's capacity to act .
856,"President Prodi , whom we thank very much , as does Mr Barnier – because we have"
857,"for the European Parliament , which was the winner of Amsterdam , there has been no increase in the"
858,so it is not enough what is written there .
859,"it is always the case that there is never enough in culture , never enough in education ."
860,but ultimately we must also stand up to those to whom we always promise everything possible in Sunday
861,what we find here is not enough to meet the audiovisual revolution .
862,nor is it enough to develop a genuine European audiovisual policy vis-à-vis
863,it is not actually enough to exploit the full potential of the sector for job creation and
864,I believe that it is precisely our task to emphasise this again and again .
865,"there is not yet a European audiovisual policy , if you will ."
866,that is why we need a great effort here .
867,"our group 's demand is twofold : firstly , the Rwandan Government must reverse"
868,"in particular , the Court of Justice must not invoke the inadmissibility of a"
869,there must be no immunity for charges in this area .

873,"if you are a skeptic , you look back to 1610 and then there"
874,do you want that ?
875,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I could actually say that Johannes has said everything ."
876,I could say the same .
877,but I might want to put some other accents .
878,the hurry we are showing is also justified by the fact that we simply want to

882,"we are seeing a plethora of individual measures , but often the second measure is"
883,it is a question of better coordinating these measures .
884,hence the request that it be finally implemented .
885,I would like to give you three reasons for this :
886,"firstly , political responsibility must also be assumed by each individual ."
887,each Commissioner is responsible and accountable for his or her department .
888,not all candidates see this in this way .
889,"secondly , there are still doubts about the Commissioner-designate for research ."
890,"I am waiting for you , Mr Prodi , to make a further statement on this ."
891,"thirdly , the re-candidacy of former Commissioners ultimately leaves the question"
892,I believe that the application of the new regulation on the conservation of fisheries resources through
893,with these many exceptions and a very small number of accidents covered by this directive
894,"the accidents have to be caused by negligence or culpable behaviour , so"
895,that is very unfortunate .
896,"Furthermore , it is the case that by linking the non-fault liability with"
897,I want to start with the point of liability .
898,"it is simply ridiculous to call on the Commission , in just one recital , to"
899,we know very well that the White Paper did not provide for liability insurance and that it only

903,we all know that Russia cannot develop a Swiss democracy overnight .
904,but Russia has set itself strict standards .

907,"in doing so , however , it has accepted for itself democratic standards of the rule of"
908,"of course , we are better off today than we were in the days of totalitarianism ,"
909,"last but not least , I would like to rebuke the Commission for not waiting for Parliament ."
910,she continues to work independently .
911,I would like to have that said .

924,"I can assure the honourable Member that the Commission does not underestimate this , quite"
925,the Commission does not have the information that the honourable Member seems to have .
926,"just a few days ago , the Turkish Foreign Minister did not say in detailed discussions with"
927,I have not heard from any other member of the Turkish government that there are plans to annex
928,I am not aware of this .
929,"if it were to happen , it would be contrary to international law and would have consequences"
930,I have already pointed this out publicly on many occasions and I am doing so here
931,I voted against the resolution because I believe that the time is very bad for a new discussion
932,"as a member of the European Parliament 's ad hoc delegation to Chechnya , I"
933,not only because we would have liked to see the situation with our own eyes - and we

946,"I am thinking , for example , of the debate we had on the issue of the money-"
947,"we always get the impression that the Commission is trying to transfer , at least in part , all"
948,but that is not possible because the structures of the liberal professions have specific features and their

955,"we have always believed that this can only work if , on the one hand , all policy"
956,there are two points that we should consider in the end .
957,"firstly , Socrates is an essential , decisive European programme , because it educates people in"

959,"however , as we have discussed on several occasions in Parliament , the conclusions are not"
960,"on the other hand , it is of course open to any party to go to the European Court"
961,the natural lead of the lawbreakers must be reduced .
962,"in this respect , the Di Pietro report is of particular importance , and I am in complete agreement"
963,"I must , however , agree with the rapporteur when he says that the Council text before us"
964,"it is not homogeneous , and it is not yet systematically mature ."
965,"I believe , however , that it can be greatly improved with the help of the a"
966,God knows I have worked on consumer protection for long enough here in this House .
967,I also believe that my reputation has clearly proved this in the past .
968,"I tell all people who call me : no product you buy today , you will not be able"
969,I will make sure they are informed about what they are buying and whether the product is
970,"whether this is proven in 24 or 30 months , I do not care"
971,"as regards the noise problem , good progress has also been made , as was demonstrated"
972,I also count on Parliament and the Council to begin work on the regulations on the other two
973,"in the regions , these situations are very , very different ."
974,that means that a lot of accompanying measures are also needed in order to be able
975,"these would include measures for vocational training , further training , the reintegration of"

985,"on the one hand , tobacco cultivation in the Union is subsidised at over EUR"
986,this conflict of objectives must be resolved in the interests of the credibility

1009,"by adopting this directive , legal certainty will be established , and then it will no"
1010,road safety is increased and the impact on people and nature is minimized .
1011,Member States which already have more liberal solutions will not be forced to introduce more restrictive measure
1012,it has already been pointed out several times today that things are mixed up .
1013,"I am not accusing Mrs Fourtou , however , but all of us who do not take"
1014,"we are mixing copyright protection with industrial property , industrial protection ."
1015,these are two different things .
1016,the same is that both are in this case an imitation and a criminal act .
1017,both must of course be punished .
1018,"it was a major concern of my fellow Members , and as rapporteur I was very"
1019,"I believe that the work that has been done by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights ,"
1020,we also call on Russia to open up Chechnya to observers – even more than it

1022,"we , as the European Parliament , should also call on our delegation , together with the relevant"
1023,"firstly , do we not already have the opportunity to take action against Switzerland ?"
1024,"I believe that what Switzerland has done in the restructuring of Swissair into Crossair ,"
1025,"even if the treaty has not yet been ratified , there are guaranteed possibilities outside"
1026,when will you do that ?
1027,the main issue raised in this context was the need for a new directive .

1425,"I made it clear to him that we are developing our own system , we are striving"
1426,I think that these wishes for talks and these statements show that we are still on
1427,"Mr President , Commissioner , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur"
1428,"in his speech , he referred to an important area , namely the institutional area and"
1429,"Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very sorry to have to contradict Mrs"
1430,"in the Conference of Presidents , in other words , the group chairmen , we said by"
1431,"that is why we are still not taking any hasty action here , partly out of solidarit"
1432,"even though the Committee on Budgets is satisfied with the procedures agreed , there"
1433,"we have put them out in our opinion , which was drafted in haste , and we"
1434,thank you for that .
1435,"the first priority for us is the issue of discharge , which , under the Treaty"
1436,"however , Article 20 of the Council decision on the financing of the Convention states that"
1437,"what exactly does this mean , especially since the terms ' approval ' , ' a"
1438,a satisfactory solution has yet to be found .
1439,I would therefore like to ask the Swedish Presidency of the Council :
1440,"if you want to show more transparency and more democracy , especially in the context of coordinating"
1441,"if such a request is made , Parliament would normally approve it ."
1442,"however , there were a number of specificities which led the Committee on Legal Affairs to deal"
1443,one of the reasons was that the original proposal that was presented to us was – I
1444,"this led to our then committee chair , Ana Palacio , writing to the German authorities in the"
1445,after another two years – that is how long this process has taken – the German authorities also
1446,there are two things we can agree on .
1447,the one principle on which we could agree was one programme and one fund .
1448,this is an effective approach to simplifying the implementation of the Structural Funds .
1449,we also agreed to support the Commission 's idea of a tripartite contract for the
1450,I hope that this will provide support for an efficient and successful approach and not jeopard
1451,"in category 3 , which includes all our priorities - not only category 3 , but"
1452,if you consider that the budget is supposed to be around EUR 6.13 billion
1453,if we also consider that four-fifths of all expenditure is determined by

1455,"another point is the debate on small-scale fishing and fishing with very large , very"
1456,I believe that it is really necessary - and I have also said this in the Commission -
1457,it is important that we also give small-scale fishing a future .
1458,the second point concerns the Convention .
1459,we must have the courage to decide on certain issues in foreign and security policy by majority vote
1460,"if everything remains unanimous , we will not be able to reach common positions ,"
1461,"the social dimension of the European Union , a prerequisite for European democracy , is also"
1462,"on the issue of foreign and security policy , this report wastes a great deal of time"
1463,"for this reason , we not only welcome the Commission 's draft directive , but also"
1464,it has been said several times today that the world drug problem must be addressed and tackle
1465,"I agree with that , of course , but the problem of the conflict in Colombia must also be"
1466,"that message has reached out , and I am proud to have been part of that delegation in"
1467,but we should not be deluded .
1468,two things have emerged : one is that we will continue to see this pooling of
1469,we will see that this clash of national and regional interests will be much more pronounced
1470,"of course , it will continue to be important that we do not play out as blocs against"
1471,"in future , it will be important to play a more intelligent and stronger preparatory role in"
1472,"I gave this statement orally to Mr Barón Crespo , but I did not sign the"
1473,"as the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats , we have said that"
1474,we have said that we want to reach a conclusion on this difficult issue in November .
1475,we stick to our word .
1476,but it is of course the responsibility of the Bureau of this Parliament to ensure that the procedure
1477,we assume that this will enable the urgent procedure to be handled properly .
1478,"on this basis , we support the vote on Thursday , i.e. today , so that"
1479,but we also expect that everything is in order formally .
1480,"at the same time , however , we must stick to the facts ."
1481,the fact is that the European Commission and the Central Bank have presented us with reports .
1482,both reports have said – the European Central Bank ’ s perhaps with some more reservations
1483,"if you look at the numbers and facts a little closer , you can notice positive and"
1484,"on the positive side , we must certainly note that inflation has fallen from 1"
1485,that is certainly a very remarkable achievement .
1486,"it is therefore not an obligation , but rather a deeply felt duty to express my"
1487,they all made an important and indispensable contribution to our success .
1488,"you have not always made it easy for me , but that is not the job of Parliament either"
1489,"but I would like to say that your comments , your interventions and also your criticism have"
1490,"I hope that in the coming weeks and months , in connection with the infrastructure charges directive"
1491,"in this sense , I would ask Parliament to be helpful and supportive in the case of"
1492,"the new motto “ Everything but arms ” sounds good , but it ’"
1493,"firstly , the arsenals of weapons are still filled to such an ex"
1494,"secondly , it is hypocritical for the European Union to preach that opening up market"
1495,"thirdly , I find it cynical when rich countries – including Germany – lure the i"
1496,"development policy is not just selflessness , it is interest policy ."
1497,"it is striking that raw materials regions are defined as areas of interest , and areas of"
1498,"when we talk about a new European Union for the 21st century , this also means"
1499,"in the Committee on Employment , we have defined reasonable adjustments very precisely"
1500,I expressly share the wish of the disabled people 's associations to have a separate

1502,the third thing we should talk about – and I am very cautious about it – is
1503,"you may say to me that this is very adventurous , but I would remind you"
1504,"that is to say , we are dealing with a real situation that we cannot avoid ."
1505,1 . 1996-1997
1506,the EU and its Member States must look more closely at the situation in Cuba and take note
1507,"Mr President-in-Office , this would be a first and very concrete step - and a"
1508,such a step would also legitimise us to go to the Irish a second time and put the
1509,"you will be judged by this , and we wish you every success in your work in the"
1510,"Commissioner , you are the guardian of the Treaties and not someone who can exceed competen"
1511,"if you refer to Article 133 for the export ban , it must be said that"
1512,"I am convinced that this legal basis is also useless , and that is why it is"
1513,"ten thousand jobs are at stake , 8 000 of which in the UK"
1514,"no one will achieve any objectives with this , because production is not restricted , it"
1515,we want to become someone who dictates how others should live .
1516,that is presumptuous and will not stand in law !
1517,I wish my successor as Parliament 's general rapporteur and the Belgian Presidency of
1518,I know from experience how difficult it is to keep all the groups in Parliament together .
1519,but I also know from discussions that it is much more difficult to formulate a negoti
1520,"this does not , of course , only apply to the purely budgetary processes , as"
1521,"among the many points made , I would also like to mention the question of the discharge"
1522,"Mrs Morgan , I would like to thank you for your proposals for clarification in the area"
1523,"the proposals of EU Commissioner Fischler do not find , in their present form , any"
1524,so we have to work on this .
1525,"despite the major economic and social adjustment of the EU candidate countries , the Berlin decisions"
1526,several discussions in which I have participated have reinforced my view for the candidate
1527,"this has a major impact on the financing of agricultural policy , and the financial perspective"
1528,the directive clearly classifies food supplements as foodstuffs .
1529,dietary supplements are not medicines and cannot replace them .
1530,"by being classified as foodstuffs , food supplements are subject to all the regulation"
1531,"consumers must be able to rely on the safety of all foods , especially substances"
1532,"our group , with the exception of the British delegation , is unanimously in favour"
1533,the draft that we have before us is balanced and has already received a great deal
1534,"of course , the Charter cannot satisfy all wishes ."
1535,it is the case with every compromise that it cannot do justice to everything .
1536,Europe can only make progress and thus find itself if everyone is willing to contribute to a
1537,this is the case with the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
1538,I believe that the approach of the e-commerce directive is politically preferable and must
1539,"for this reason , I propose that the further procedure should either postpone the Brussels / Lu"
1540,we therefore need a realistic fisheries policy with Greenland .
1541,I therefore call for a cost-benefit analysis before renewal and a mid-
1542,"unfortunately , in the past six months , it has not been possible to substantially improve"
1543,the German proposal to designate them as candidates for accession and to measure them according to
1544,it will be important for Turkey to draw up a road map for implementing the Copenhagen criteria
1545,their fulfilment will be essential for the opening of accession negotiations .
1546,"if the rigid limit currently in force is maintained , producer organisations will be forced to"
1547,the consequence would then be that producer organisations would be weakened in terms of their
1548,I therefore ask that this be taken into account .
1549,"Madam President , I am disgusted by the political ignorance of this Commission , that is"
1550,he should actually consider his position on the Tobin tax and why he is here at all !
1551,what is this compromise about ?
1552,"firstly , we want to move the date of entry into force a little forward for certain"
1553,"that is somewhere in the middle between the decision of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health"
1554,we Liberals therefore support the Committee on Legal Affairs ' request to the Commission to draw up
1555,"secondly , we are opposed to all the points that go against the basic principle of solidarit"
1556,Mr Nassauer has already pointed out that this is a request for interference with civil

1559,we have been saying for many years - since 1996 - that we want a

1562,"however , unless we all realise that we have always turned a blind eye to the fact"
1563,that is why we must have quality standards for animal feed .
1564,we must have other controls of the animal protein product .
1565,"but we also have to consider ourselves as consumers , how we consume , what"
1566,"Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish we did not have to hold this debate"
1567,"this is a serious process , a serious political mistake ."
1568,"after what we have just heard from President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen , I hope that"
1569,"after this very serious criticism , I would like to say a word of thanks to the Commission"
1570,I would like to thank everyone very much for their great work .
1571,but public interests are also at stake .
1572,"it is unclear , for example , whether public libraries will be allowed to lend books"
1573,this directly affects the right to equal access to education .
1574,why is the Commission silent about this ?
1575,does it want to privatise education as well ?
1576,"economic interests are very large in the treaties , but public interest is very small ."
1577,it is about the Commission 's accountability to the European Parliament .
1578,"we will have to discuss this in detail with the President-designate of the Commission , Romano"
1579,"Mr Prodi has already made extensive concessions , and I would ask you to refr"
1580,it goes without saying that there can also be confidential documents .
1581,it must be clear who is responsible for what in the Commission .
1582,only if there is responsibility will there be the necessary pressure for correct behaviour .
1583,then there is the Intergovernmental Conference . Madam President-in-Office of the Council
1584,"of course , the crucial thing is the extension of majority decision-making ."
1585,but it is also crucial that the European Parliament should be given the right of codecision wherever
1586,if we want to be represented as the European Union in the globalising world economy and
1587,"of course , we can argue about whether one or another exemption should be allowed"
1588,this would not have been a problem for us in the search for a compromise .
1589,it is a pity that we did not reach this compromise .
1590,the way is right .
1591,and anyone who believes – and I would like to say this despite all the anger express
1592,I think that we have a duty of solidarity to find an answer .
1593,"I believe that we have found this answer , and we have also found ways of providing for"
1594,"similar to Article 3 ( 4 ) , Article 16 of the Common Position provides for"
1595,this totally absurd approach could set a dangerous precedent and should therefore be removed from

1597,"in the opinion of many Members , the Commission 's information policy , particularly in the"
1598,the Commission 's commitment to work closely with Parliament on this issue also leaves something
1599,"in many Member States where the Commission has information offices , it is not possible to reach a"

1608,"I raised this issue with the competent Commissioner , Mr Monti , when the euro was"
1609,"it has taken years , and that is a pity because so much damage has been done ."
1610,I believe that we should - to emphasise this once again - listen closer to the
1611,the Commission is following the human rights situation in Djibouti with great attention and concern .
1612,it must note that the fundamental freedoms of the opponents of the current regime in Dji
1613,the Commission will continue to make every effort to ensure that the fundamental rights of the prisoners are
1614,"in our contacts with the authorities of the country , we have repeatedly expressed our"
1615,respect for human rights is one of the essential elements of our cooperation with Djibouti
1616,the European Parliament has now also made its contribution .
1617,"under pressure of time , my colleague Mrs Buitenweg has presented a report on"
1618,what I have just talked about is nothing more and nothing less than the concern of the Committee
1619,this alone can ensure greater social balance .
1620,"Commissioner , this is something that should be on the negotiating table , and that is what"
1621,the situation is somewhat different when traditional methods are used in production in small-scale farms
1622,"here , the possibilities of implementing the regulation are often objectively limited ."
1623,"derogations from the rules should , however , be limited to the presence of official control"
1624,a restriction of hygiene standards is not acceptable under any circumstances .
1625,the concept of “ from farmer to consumer ” is an important basis for high food safety .
1626,the effectiveness of the system depends on the quality of information from the farmer to the store
1627,"this is a fundamentally new approach , and we should emphasise it again and again ."
1628,"however , the information should be limited to criteria relevant to slaughter inspection and food safety"
1629,"I am therefore all the more grateful to the rapporteur , Mrs Napoletano"
1630,I very much hope that the European Commission will take the European Parliament 's demands seriously
1631,"in terms of substance , I of course agree with the need for dialogue between the European Union"
1632,"however , I have absolutely no understanding for the fact that negotiations on a cooperation"
1633,the European Parliament has repeatedly called for cooperation agreements or financial aid to be
1634,why then do we measure with such different standards ?
1635,firstly – and I do not want to deny this – Turkey is an important economic factor
1636,one should not deny that at all .
1637,"young technologies need unbureaucratic , uncomplicated and effective support mechanisms ."
1638,I would like to take this opportunity to stress in particular the importance of renewable energy for
1639,"the production of energy , the cultivation of energy crops , offers an alternative income possibility"
1640,the multifunctionality of rural areas can therefore be reinforced and used more extensivel
1641,I see in this the great opportunity for agriculture and a healthy rural area in our common Europe
1642,our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has gone to great lengths to put forward its
1643,"in my old age , I am of course pleased that this resolution states that the great experience"
1644,"the path of suffering often has serious consequences , not only for the affected themselves in"
1645,all this goes hand in hand with bullying .
1646,the most important point of the reform proposal – and many have stressed this – is the replacement
1647,this brings a whole series of significant advantages .
1648,this new aid is stable .
1649,it is also predictable .
1650,this also gives the farmer the appropriate planning security .
1651,"it is also much less bureaucratic , above all , because all the expensive price report"
1652,"as a committee , we adopted our recommendation unanimously because it was very important for"
1653,"for this reason , we welcome such programmes ."
1654,"Mr President , I would just like to correct you a little :"
1655,"this is not the last Friday in Strasbourg that we meet , but the provisional last"
1656,"in the European Union , the value of the fish processing industry is almost twice as high as"
1657,"given the economic power of this industry , with a production value of over EUR 10"
1658,the directive does not correspond 100 % to Parliament 's ideas in all areas
1659,"nevertheless , I agree with the rapporteur , whom I thank very much for his work"
1660,we want this directive to be implemented as quickly as possible .
1661,that is why we do not want to have petty discussions here .
1662,"one could discuss , for example , whether we need realistic values , because everyone knows"
1663,the decision of the 14 has done great damage to the European awareness of the people
1664,and I think it is more than questionable whether this damage can be compensated for by a
1665,Mr Schröder 's big announcement that the European Employment Pact was in
1666,an opulent menu was planned ;
1667,comes out is lean food .
1668,the so-called ‘ Cologne process ’ only means setting in motion a macroeconomic

1670,"first , the length of the entire control procedure ."
1671,"in its practical form , it is not acceptable ."
1672,"I am saying this very clearly , and you know it ."
1673,it is simply impossible that two full years should pass from the start of the investigation to the

1675,"this is not about carrying out the checks , which take their time , but about the"
1676,there is therefore a need for action .
1677,it is urgent to find modalities that will allow the special report to be published in a reason

1691,only together can we make the fight against fraud more efficient and therefore more successful .
1692,"we need , on the one hand , better coordination in this context towards cooperation and information"
1693,"Commissioner , the EU policy should be geared so that we move away from short-term food"

1703,despite massive attempts to intimidate voters - and this will be repeated

1705,more important than legal restrictions and electronic filters is the acquisition of media literacy for
1706,this is an educational and social policy task .
1707,we suggest the gentle way of decoupling .
1708,at this point : no .
1709,"however , the Committee on Agriculture proposes a review in 2008 , after experience"
1710,then you can also estimate the effect and consequences and design the instrument accordingly .
1711,"I must tell you , Mr Groenland , that I had to convince myself"
1712,"I would also support a European Year of the Book or of Reading , given our young people'"
1713,Europe must start from the basic premise that only a fair and open partnership between equals

1732,our committee also supports the active involvement of civil society in the Member States and candidate countries
1733,"the prerequisite for this will be good , comprehensive and above all not only"
1734,there is another concern which has already reached the Commission .
1735,Commissioner Verheugen has already raised the issue in this morning 's debate that the application
1736,we can only agree with him in this respect .
1737,"tomorrow , in the trialogue , it is up to the Council to reach out to"

1739,"this is not just about Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement , but also about"
1740,I would like to emphasise once again that strict requirements and extensive documentation of control

1743,"it is undisputed that preventing food crises is very , very important not only"

1745,"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs . – Mr President , the rapport"
1746,it is not necessary to repeat anything .
1747,I would like to raise two questions and add to them .
1748,"Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to say that the European Union is a European Union of"
1749,you have pointed to many possibilities and impossibilities .
1750,"as author and committee chair , I would like to refer to the question that you have not answer"
1751,no one wants to change the Treaty at the moment .
1752,the question is whether a solution can be found within the framework of the 199

1759,the fish on our plates is increasingly rarely coming from European Union waters .
1760,the domestic supply cannot meet the European demand .
1761,this domestic offer does not offer sufficient prospects .

1774,I hope we will not disappoint them !
1775,I insist on making it clear that abortion must not be stylised as the preferred means of
1776,"it is also unacceptable that the pill is then distributed free of charge in schools ,"
1777,that cannot be !
1778,what kind of logic is that ?
1779,"I believe that it would have been more sensible to first convene an expert group , present results"
1780,"we have made money available for one of the European Union 's biggest problems , underemployment ."
1781,I will give you the expenditure ratio in the area of employment policy : 3
1782,"we have several million unemployed , money has been made available and only nearly 4"
1783,you can hardly explain this to a European citizen anymore .
1784,"in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , other important amendments were approved"
1785,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by saying that :"
1786,I would first like to thank Mr Swoboda very warmly for his report and also thank
1787,I believe that we can conclude this debate by saying that there is a greater agreement on
1788,"we agree that the current situation of human rights , the protection of minorities , the quality of"
1789,"unfortunately , nothing has changed ."
1790,there is no point in embellishment of this statement or in concealing anything from the
1791,"it is precisely because this is the case , because the situation is so unsatisfactory"
1792,this brings me to my second point .
1793,"the Commission can also accept a number of other amendments , but they require one or two"
1794,"these are Amendments Nos 4 , 14 , 17 , 2"
1795,"Mr President , I would like to say something about the vote , namely that there could be"
1796,"I do not want to do that , but I would ask Mrs Buitenweg and her friends"
1797,Mr Mombaur was right to point out – or so I interpreted him – that this
1798,"but it also calls for framework directives from the European Union , a framework within which"
1799,that is the new task that the European Union is facing .
1800,"we therefore need more Europe in this area , not less ."
1801,"Mr President , I am here today to report on the deliberations on the Green Paper on e"
1802,"in fact , there are three documents , namely , in addition to the Green Paper , the"
1803,"we in Parliament have limited ourselves to the Green Paper , and I would firstly like"
1804,"in these days and hours , we are thinking of the allied soldiers in Iraq , some"
1805,"but because human dignity is indivisible , we also think of the soldiers of Iraq ,"
1806,I hope that what was expressed in good words in the conclusions of the summit here
1807,"that must be our goal , and we as Europeans must not say goodbye now , but"
1808,the Commission nevertheless believes that a negotiated solution that takes sufficient account of
1809,"however , should Spain 's concerns not be duly addressed , the Commission is ready"
1810,a second point : this directive has also clearly shown the problems we have in the
1811,"we received the Commission proposal in October 2000 , Parliament concluded its first reading"
1812,today we have the debate at second reading and tomorrow the vote .
1813,I would like to make it very clear here - and this must be recalled - that
1814,Parliament 's first reading had 458 votes in favour .
1815,"if the Council had taken that outstretched hand , we would have had this directive long"
1816,"in 2005 , citizens will have the option of returning their products free of"
1817,this can then be decided individually in the Member States .
1818,the question that arises is : do we want and can we solve the problems of the
1819,my clear answer is :
1820,"no , it is all the more obvious as we all know about the problems and risks"
1821,"at the same time , Mr Evans wants to abolish the safe third country status , contra"
1822,my conclusion is that the Evans report is irresponsible in its present form .
1823,it gives the Member States sufficient arguments not to grant us codecision rights on this issue
1824,"this is also the context in which the most important and visible outcome of the conference , na"
1825,"President Bush 's announcement of USD 5 billion , which was then further increased during the"
1826,"it is not presumptuous , but we , as the European Union , have the leading"
1827,"Europe is small on the globe , and therefore the internal market completed by monetary"
1828,the euro also demonstrates the ability of Europeans to organise a common interest for all
1829,it is both a link and a catalyst for further bold European projects .
1830,I have been told by my chairman of the Committee on Budgets that this is the first time
1831,well done !
1832,"the minority in the committee has primarily tried to highlight the fact that , contrary to"
1833,the Commission has not presented a transparency study or guidelines for aid control .
1834,that is why a minority in the committee proposed the inclusion of new provisions on
1835,"Mr President , I would first like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Morillon and Mr"
1836,"Mr Morillon , I think your report is extremely realistic and responsible ."
1837,"in the months since the decision of the Helsinki Council , there have indeed been some interesting symboli"
1838,"however , the oppressive situation in Turkish prisons , the discrimination against the Kurds and"
1839,"the role of the Turkish military in the state , which is incompatible with the rule of"
1840,"even if there are divergences of opinion in my group on the Morillon report , it"
1841,"compromises are almost everywhere , but not here ."
1842,"firstly , we expect comprehensive policies for managing migration that do not over"
1843,"we expect permanent instruments for solidarity-based solutions to the influx of refugees , and"
1844,"for us , burden-sharing in the reception of refugees is essential , just"
1845,we need lasting solutions here .
1846,what we also need – and I am glad you mentioned this – are instruments to combat illegal
1847,we therefore expect that Eurodac will be implemented quickly and that the Schengen security system
1848,we also expect effective measures to be taken in the fight against organised crime .
1849,Europol must be expanded and given operational powers .
1850,cross-border police cooperation must be extended to include cooperation in training and cooperation
1851,"of course , we expect that in judicial cooperation legal certainty for citizens is guaranteed ,"
1852,free general elections are scheduled for March 2000 .
1853,"the international donor community , including Swiss organizations in particular , is now ready to take up"
1854,now that the situation has calmed down and there are overall more favourable prospects for
1855,we hope that this will send Tajikistan a sufficiently clear signal to improve its state structure in
1856,"secondly , I firmly believe that it was right to reform the common agricultural policy"
1857,we have made these reforms for ourselves – and I should like to remind you
1858,we have said that European society is calling for reforms and that is why we need them .
1859,we cannot now say afterwards that we pursued our plan to make European agriculture and
1860,that would really be turning things upside down .
1861,"firstly , the Commission is asked and encouraged to present a communication this year outlining"
1862,I also think it is appropriate that this communication should include a comprehensive approach to
1863,this would inevitably require a revision of Directive 268 / 75 and the
1864,I can assure you that the Commission will follow the progress of the investigations very closely .
1865,"of course , we will work to ensure that any misconduct is immediately corrected"
1866,"what is welcome , however , is that the Commission is aware of the difficult situation in the border"
1867,I personally welcome it very much and would like to conclude by saying that a united Europe
1868,"Mr President , I must and I can be brief ."
1869,"this week , for the first time , we are able to adopt a European Union act that was"
1870,it is about improving the protection of accident victims in the European Union .
1871,"with this directive , we have solved a large part of the problems that normally ari"
1872,"Mr President , I would like to ask the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , after the"
1873,what I still missed is the time frame .
1874,"we had expected the Spanish Presidency to present a proper , sensible and effective proposal by June"
1875,"in particular , however , I would like to emphasise the correct statement that all other health"
1876,"fourthly , we must make it easier to set up businesses and we must support"
1877,"if we act in accordance with the guidelines and these principles , we will not only"
1878,we have often complained in plenary about the lack of timely information from company
1879,"we can also send positive messages , however ."
1880,this includes the success story of the European Works Council Directive .
1881,"the prerequisite for good functioning is that the national local workers ' representatives ,"
1882,this is what the directive guarantees .
1883,then a very specific question .
1884,"there was also anxiety in Hungary about the fact that the Status Act , i.e"
1885,"this law was adopted by 95 % of the Hungarian Parliament , and a commission of"
1886,"Mr President , the title of this item on the agenda itself points to the importance of Article"
1887,"the extension of the scope to services is an understandable concern , but it has little to"
1888,"I think that , given the rather bleak prospects for success , it would not be a"
1889,"in fact , at the current stage of the negotiations , it is doubtful whether"
1890,"Mr rapporteur , this is not about the traditional canal ships in Great Britain , it is"
1891,"they are not the decisive problem , and we have also created exceptions for them ."
1892,"the crucial problem is that of recreational vehicles and , I repeat , water scooters"
1893,"Commissioner , I think it is clear that we must at last align ourselves with the"
1894,"we have simply put EU money in the sand in too many places , and that is no longer"
1895,"Mr President , with this regulation , the European Union has an instrument and the legal , but also"
1896,"this , of course , requires sufficient financial support ."
1897,that is why I am in favour of approving Amendment 11 by the
1898,"we also need to act in foreign , security and defence policy ."
1899,"just last week , the Institute for Strategic Studies in London said that the Europeans are not"
1900,"this is not just a question of the institution , but of the willingness of the Member States"
1901,"we expect the new High Representative , Mr Solana , in consultation with Chris Patten"
1902,we now need a major debate on the geographical expansion of the European Union and on its
1903,"in a few weeks ' time , the Commission will publish the Green Paper together with the reports"
1904,we must use the discussion that will then begin to consider how to remedy the shortcomings
1905,"I would advise against being distracted from the real task , which is to change this country"
1906,I would advise against being distracted by this and engaging in a fruitless data discussion
1907,the Member States of the European Union and the European Commission have also demonstrated their commitment to
1908,we reaffirm our readiness to examine how we can contribute to the future work
1909,the Commission shares the view expressed in the debate that this court will not have a pure
1910,I would also like to mention that the 2000 budget will increase the staffing
1911,the only directive in force in this area only provides temporary protection .
1912,"this rule applies only in exceptional cases , namely in the event of a mass influ"
1913,the directive on the reception of asylum seekers will be the first binding regulation
1914,"in Basel , the focus is primarily on the large banks ."
1915,but we in Europe must look at the small banks .
1916,there are the customers with low liquidity .
1917,we know that the big banks are no longer interested in it .
1918,we must of course also be careful that Basel does not lead to a second disadvantage for
1919,"as we have repeatedly said , the small and medium-sized enterprises would"
1920,internal and external ratings have just been discussed .
1921,I would like to add the portfolio spread .
1922,"we must ensure that the level of risk is assessed and not just the abstract credit , so"
1923,"Mr President , if we make the wrong choices at this historic moment , we will lead Europe"
1924,"we will have nothing left if , following the method of the Intergovernmental Conference , we"
1925,what is left for us in the crisis ?
1926,"therefore , however difficult this compromise has been for us all , we should defend the Convention"
1927,their proposals are harmful to European integration .
1928,"we reject them and support the amendments tabled by our and your chairman , Mr"
1929,we focused on medical research because we saw that this was where the greatest need for change
1930,the Commission 's approach of promoting biotechnology only in the context of health is too na
1931,other research areas are also promising for health and must be supported .
1932,"I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Caudron , for his efforts in this area"
1933,we demand the immediate release and restoration of democratic rights of Yawowi Agboyibo
1934,the president should practically release him now after more than five months of sentence .
1935,we do not demand pardon .
1936,"he has done no wrong , he has only pointed out wrongdoing , and he should"
1937,a second point : I do not understand why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is
1938,it was therefore necessary to place the concept of the social market economy at the centre of
1939,I would extend it to the eco-social market economy .
1940,what do we mean by that ?
1941,we are against dividing growth and employment apart .
1942,"that is why we are committed to the Stability Pact , growth and employment ."
1943,"the social market economy promotes social responsibility , ecological sustainability and educational policie"
1944,I would like to mention four points .
1945,"firstly , we have agreed – and I am very pleased about this – that the"
1946,it is a matter of all the peoples and all the countries in this region cooperating with
1947,"therefore , this division is certainly a division that we fully support ."
1948,"meanwhile , South Africa ’ s Minister of Economic Affairs – after all , a member"
1949,we want to promote this policy of liberalising trade and restructuring the economy with this
1950,I firmly believe that a clear signal from those who were expelled in 19
1951,a signal that states that the property relations that arose after the Second World War are invi
1952,"if this signal were to come , fears in the Czech Republic would be reduced and the"
1953,"Mr President , Commissioner , I am very pleased with the report ."
1954,"on behalf of our group , I would like to thank our colleague , Mrs de"
1955,"I would like to point out that this Europe of knowledge , which we now also use as a"
1956,"this is an important challenge , and the Lisbon and Barcelona declarations , or what was adopted"
1957,"we agree with the content , but we also want to be involved ."
1958,I had the honour of attending the 20th anniversary of the accession
1959,I looked at it from close up .
1960,it was impressive when the Spanish king came to Marrakech and together with the Moroccan
1961,"this reminded me of images from our history and from my childhood , when Konrad"
1962,my colleague next door made a very nice comment .
1963,"he said : "" we have the safest lifts in Europe ."
1964,they are so safe because they no longer work .
1965,"therefore , nothing can happen ."
1966,""" but maybe they should also fulfill their function ."
1967,I am even more critical of the area of transparency .
1968,Mr Titley is talking about transparency in the form of a framework agreement .
1969,"we know , however , that the framework agreement between six EU countries to promote defence industry"
1970,this must change .
1971,"we must commit ourselves today to declaring a decisive fight against terrorism , so that"
1972,the most important innovations are :
1973,the EPP Group also believes that nuclear energy is indispensable to reduce greenhouse
1974,"a phase-out of nuclear energy , as planned and implemented in some Member States ,"
1975,"before you get out , you have to say how you want to reduce greenhouse gases ."
1976,"Mr President , I voted against this report because it does not meet the expectations that its"
1977,"the main focus is on religious fundamentalism , the other forms of fundamentalism are only brief"
1978,"even though this is the most important and dominant form of fundamentalism , it is essential for a"
1979,"the threat of fundamentalism is taking on proportions that , in view of 11"
1980,"if we want to do justice to the situation , we must not confine ourselves to"
1981,just as people obsessed with the idea of a fundamental order can be found in all positions
1982,"secondly , there is the issue of the coherence of legislation , and it should"
1983,the way Latin America will develop in the coming years and decades will also depend very much on
1984,I think we are underestimating our possibilities .
1985,"I would like to point out here that relations with Latin America must also include a scientific , technical"
1986,"firstly , the Constitution lays down the rights and duties of citizens ."
1987,we have made the Charter of Fundamental Rights an integral and legally binding part of the
1988,the second is the burning of so-called associated gas in Russia and also in
1989,this will release CO2 amounts that far exceed what we have saved in recent years
1990,"by the way , this will burn more gas than we import from Russia ."
1991,I just want to draw your attention to this phenomenon .
1992,it requires more than just a report .
1993,"in fact , politics – perhaps even at the highest level – is also needed here ."
1994,I really wanted to address this phenomenon once again .
1995,"this Article 4 is not an instrument that can be used at will , but is intended"
1996,if we want to take this debate out of its broad scope and if we want to change
1997,then there will be another BSE debate tomorrow .
1998,I like to run them !
1999,I have no problem with that .
2000,I also think that I know the many folders almost by heart .
2001,I can do that .
2002,but I don 't think we should do that .
2003,I also believe that there is another reason why we should not do so .
2004,"firstly , the supply of food must be guaranteed in any event in the event of e"
2005,"a quick and unbureaucratic handling is necessary here , because only if the a"
2006,better coordination between donor countries through a binding strategy will also help to ensure that
2007,"on the whole , however , the common points fortunately outweighed , and I should"
2008,I hope that we will soon be able to report on the first positive projects from the new LIFE
2009,"I think that , with this feeling of aches and pains , I would be very happy"
2010,"but I too agree with the crucial points , the core points , which have already been mentioned"
2011,"with this lavish or somewhat too meagre diet , I think a millimeter or two"
2012,"I would like to hear what you might have to say to us , and then , even if"
2013,the protection of privacy must be ensured .
2014,access to the registers must be restricted and their content must be treated as confiden
2015,best practices must be identified and then applied throughout Europe .
2016,we need research and further development of safety and compatibility .
2017,the introduction of a passport for implant recipients and mandatory follow-up check-ups
2018,I would ask you very sincerely to make a strong impact on your Member States on these two
2019,"in this respect , I believe that we must insist that this category of ‘ three stars ’"
2020,"either these are priority hazardous substances , in which case they should be phase"
2021,we cannot accept such a “ three-star ” category .
2022,"these are substances for which there are real indications , for example lead and lead compounds"
2023,"it seems , Commissioner , that the Commission has some indications that they may be among the priorit"
2024,the Commission must therefore abolish this ‘ three-star ’ category as soon as possible
2025,that is why I think that this must happen before the normal review date .
2026,"whether this has to be done by 1 July 2002 , as we"
2027,but for this “ three star ” category something has to happen faster .
2028,we see the Mediterranean dialogue as an important challenge .
2029,that is why we have proposed that the Euro-Mediterranean meeting be held in
2030,I thank the President for having quickly implemented our joint decision in the Conference of Presidents .
2031,we hope that this will be a signal for cooperation with the Arab and Islamic worlds .
2032,"before I turn to the amendments tabled for tomorrow 's vote , I would"
2033,"as you know , I have been pressing for an informal trialogue on the issue"
2034,this took place on May 3rd .
2035,"at that meeting , the Members present also expressed the wish that the Council 's draf"
2036,I therefore thank Mr Liese and all the others who have taken this initiative for present
2037,"for the first time , what this brief resolution contains is not a response to crises , as"
2038,the second issue that is important here is the question of the transfer of funds under heading
2039,this is only a technical question .
2040,it is a very political question .
2041,I myself have already said here on another occasion that I think this idea is right .
2042,I think I can say - without the Commission having already taken a formal decision - that the Commission
2043,on the report by Mrs Haug .
2044,"Mrs Haug , I really should like to congratulate you on this report and on your"
2045,"instead , they have concentrated on real priorities , and I believe that this is also"
2046,"Commissioner Byrne , in connection with the BSE crisis you made a clear statement that animal material"
2047,this is actually the logical consequence if we know about the cycle of the food chain .
2048,"I thank the Commission for its decisive proposal , which divides animal by-products into"
2049,it would have been much easier to ban them all at once .
2050,"this is the path chosen by the German government , for example ."
2051,"in my opinion , however , the EU is taking the more sensible route , although - as"
2052,"the materials of the three categories must be collected , stored , treated and market"
2053,"according to our experience , such a requirement also requires controls ."
2054,if the Info Points and Carrefours are to be closed down and we are now he
2055,"we do not need an additional year or a second year because we have elections next year , but"
2056,"Commissioner , I am deeply convinced that when we talk about joining forces – as has"
2057,we need to expand information services in general and we need to set priorities differently .
2058,it is absolutely necessary that we integrate volunteering in the Member States into these information
2059,I would also like to point out once again that the local elections and therefore our observation
2060,I hope that we will work together with the Commission on a good strategy in this area .
2061,"however , we must not discard the internal market like an old hat ."
2062,the introduction of the euro has already highlighted all the shortcomings of the internal market and
2063,any failure of the internal market weakens Europe economically and in its credibility in
2064,"if it helps to give the internal market project new impetus , then we should also be"
2065,other issues discussed at this Council meeting concern trade facilitation measures .
2066,these measures are also intended to contribute to the economic support of the northern part
2067,Turkish Minister of State Gürel had stated before the meeting that these measures are aimed
2068,"he has , however , rejected the idea that the integration of the northern part of"
2069,the second key point is the statement that the documents of the institutions are made public in principle .
2070,the necessary exceptions must be justified .
2071,this is now anchored .
2072,"Furthermore , I did not think it was appropriate at the time to draw up"
2073,"now to the third objective , sustainable growth ."
2074,"I admit it is a very vague term , but it is a term under which I can"
2075,I just wonder if we really have a coherent growth policy .
2076,"we are investing too little , too little in research and development , but also in infrastructure ."
2077,"let us think of public transport , which could also do more for the environment at the same time"
2078,too little is being done to make educational institutions more efficient and yet accessible to
2079,"thirdly , Korea needs support to recover from its state bankruptcy ."
2080,the IMF payments speak a clear language .
2081,a clear distinction must be made between asylum seekers and refugees on the one hand
2082,this enables regulations that do justice to people and their situation .
2083,a large part of my amendments are aimed at this separation .
2084,"objectives and means for rural areas can be developed centrally , but they must be regional"
2085,"Europe 's rural areas are very diverse and have different characteristics , advantages ,"
2086,"therefore , the rural development programme must be an instrument that is very strongly regionalised in"
2087,"Furthermore , there is a need for fundamental motivation and participation in the regions ."
2088,the contribution under discussion in the form of an EIB loan of EUR 250
2089,this is why the procedure proposed by the Commission and supported in the report is inevitable
2090,the emerging and so far unsolved problem is actually quite different .
2091,"in general , new political challenges also require more financial expenditure , and more financial expendi"
2092,"therefore , general consideration must be given - and hopefully a positive political decision must be"
2093,"I would like to thank the Bureau of the European Parliament today , and in particular the Vice-"
2094,I would like to thank the relevant departments of Parliament 's administration for their prompt and dili

2097,"I would like to congratulate all my colleagues on this and , of course ,"
2098,I think I can present you with a budget that has earned Parliament 's confidence .
2099,I therefore have relatively little understanding for the frequently repeated call for the funding
2100,it can always be a support and a participation in projects .
2101,that is a very basic point .
2102,"together , the three laws we are adopting here are milestones for the EU internal"
2103,"after 15 years of discussion , you are taking seriously the freedoms guaranteed to"
2104,these directives also state this explicitly .
2105,"Furthermore , they are creating efficient European companies through the pressure of competition ,"
2106,"in order to reduce the burden of administrative decisions , the Commission should give applicants the"

2108,"this applies to all three programmes , on the one hand , in order to have an"
2109,"this is not only about the cultivation of soy and rapeseed , but also of oilseed"
2110,I therefore consider traceability of products to be particularly important in order to offer the consumer
2111,the cultivation of protein-rich crops also contributes to a diverse crop rotation
2112,"the political issue is Article 152 , which clearly states that a high level of"

2114,the deletion of this recital proposed in Amendment No 2 cannot therefore

2117,"the findings and analyses of this report remain essentially valid , even though the rapporteur"
2118,"it is true , however , that the Eurostat affair has brought existing shortcomings ,"

2486,the European Union budget already provides for the current financial year under line B3-500
2487,this is indeed not a horn of fulfilment as the unfavorable see it .
2488,the distribution of the funds is also regulated in the regulation .
2489,"thankfully , in February the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation to set out the conditions"
2490,this includes the submission of a statute demonstrating that a European political party is committed

2704,I believe that it is almost a world record for these three European institutions to be able to bring

2714,"I have the impression that today you are following the proverb “ The spirits I called ,"
2715,what the rapporteur has proposed to us is not an environmental proposal .

2783,we have hardly made any progress in this area either .
2784,there are always positive and negative signs .
2785,those who know that it is a crucial issue lack the courage to do so .
2786,you mentioned the Corsican problem .

2817,the European social model has made a significant contribution to social peace and to increasing European productivity
2818,"it is a flexible model , not a rigid one , and therefore worth expanding ."

2821,"this is especially true of the gene transfer , which simply cannot be prevented in the open field"

2836,our task as politicians is to defend the interests of consumers in particular .
2837,we want our consumers to get as much as possible for the wages they receive .
2838,that is why the reduction of postal services costs is a very important challenge for consumers .
2839,we should look at – also by means of benchmarking – what a consumer currently pays for

2851,"if we work towards it , this goal is realistic , but it is not a dogma"

2870,enlargement offers us a unique opportunity to change the course of European history and to ensure peace for
2871,expansion is not an adventure .
2872,it is prepared as thoroughly as possible .
2873,it would be an adventure to abandon the project or postpone it indefinitely .
2874,we have a window of opportunity .
2875,it is now open .
2876,it won 't stay open forever .
2877,there are risks .
2878,no one can avoid it .
2879,but that must not discourage us from our determination .
2880,it would be a much greater risk not to do what needs to be done !
2881,I would like to respond to the questions raised by explaining the Commission 's position on
2882,"first of all , however , I would like to point out that transport infrastructure will be of central"
2883,a large internal market with over 500 million European consumers needs transport links to make
2884,"the infrastructure for this is partly in place , at least in half of the future Union ."
2885,"we have developed , or are in the process of improving , the relevant essential infrastructure measure"
2886,"we must organise something similar , and in particular the connection for Central and Eastern Europe ."
2887,the TINA report provides the relevant perspectives .
2888,the Financial Perspective provides some of the funds .
2889,"whether this will be sufficient is a question , and PHARE , ISPA and other"

2910,but here I am very surprised .

2916,"Mrs Niebler is not an institution , but she has behaved almost like an institution ."
2917,thank you for the report .
2918,but I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council .
2919,"the Council , because it has moved to a degree that we did not expect some time ago ,"

2921,we should also set out to work more responsibly once our decisions have become legally

2925,we wish you good luck with your work !

2947,"in this connection , I would like to remind you of the evaluation being carried out"
2948,this communication will be a valuable tool for the mid-term evaluation of the programme .
2949,we have also developed an impressive range of measures to promote employment .

2959,we in the Committee on Budgets are convinced that the wording as it has been found

2980,the Commission has proposed a forward-looking system – admittedly with a long target

2982,"we need systems that work – plural – they have to exist , they have to work and they"
2983,"nothing against , very much for satellite technology , but not so !"
2984,is the bankruptcy in Germany not enough for us ?
2985,technology neutrality is what we need here and now and will need for a number of years .
2986,"in this respect , we must thank the rapporteur , Mrs Sommer , very much for steering"
2987,"I would have liked , however , to see even clearer wording , namely that"
2988,every citizen must be treated and informed individually and personally .
2989,the Commission must notify the complainant promptly and consistently .
2990,it is important that the complainant has the real opportunity to present his complaint to the Commission

2999,this contradicts all the rhetoric we are seeing these days .

3001,"Madam President , I am only asking for the floor briefly because , in view of the"
3002,"so if you are in the rapporteur 's opinion , you must vote against the report ."
3003,perhaps we as Europeans must first learn how to support a people in a foreign country in

3035,let me conclude by saying that we have also heard with great concern – we will hear this
3036,we really think that this is a totally crazy development .
3037,if what is necessary in the social and ecological field for the development of rural areas is

3039,we have tabled 134 and 110 different split votes on my

3041,the next point concerns funding .
3042,"there are enterprises of the same size , not small and large , but of the same"
3043,"that is , he gets more than the labour force costs him ."
3044,if I could get that much per worker in my 50-hectare farm
3045,the five people I employ have to be paid from production and not from what comes from Brussels
3046,we must come up with social criteria here which also guarantee some degree of equal treatment if

3048,this ensures the quality of the products and the greatest possible protection of human health .
3049,the protection and promotion of children 's rights is a priority under the European Initiative for Democracy

3051,"a wide range of other measures are being taken by the relevant international organisations , in particular"

3064,"we will have to take a long breath , and I do not know whether human rights are really"
3065,but it is certain that the crime has also become public .
3066,"we are learning more today , and this naturally also puts us under the pressure to act"
3067,"the fact that crime is now public and almost always accompanied by a camera , however"
3068,the real reason why European countries are getting a bad grade is that the structural reforms that
3069,"firstly , the flexibility of the labour markets ."
3070,"we see that unemployment has fallen faster in those countries , including those of the European Union"
3071,"in some countries , it is now below 5 % ."
3072,I agree with you that we must do everything possible to make this agreement a success .
3073,"but we also all know that this will be extremely difficult , and you mentioned the discussion"

3076,"in this case , the Commission intends to make appropriate use of the relevant provisions"

3078,it will therefore be important that the Council takes a decision in due time so that we have
3079,the attacks on refugee trains and residential areas and the closure of borders
3080,I think it is obvious and essential that the European Union should increase its humanitarian aid
3081,"we must not , however , relieve Russia of its responsibility to provide for the protection and"
3082,the same applies to the reconstruction of the country .
3083,"it is difficult for me , even with my nationality – I was born after the war –"
3084,I find it cynical when the Prime Minister of Israel speaks of a rise in anti
3085,"no , we are not anti-Semitic !"
3086,"we want Israel to live in peace , within secure borders ."
3087,we stand with all Israelis in this .
3088,this has nothing to do with anti-Semitism at all !
3089,we reject this labelling in the strongest possible terms !
3090,I therefore wonder why the Structural Funds have not been used more efficiently
3091,even the cumulation of funds from the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds

3125,millions of cases are affected here every day .
3126,we wish the Commission a happy hand in evaluating the results of the Green Paper .
3127,we are nevertheless pleased that this programme has come out as we wanted it to .
3128,it is what citizens expect of us .
3129,"we support small and medium-sized events , not the big ones , we allow the"
3130,"I think that the fact that culture is now in the hands of one Commissioner , together with education"
3131,that is why we want to insist and press for Turkey to be brought closer to the EU

3133,we in the European Parliament are therefore waiting with great eagerness for the Commission 's

3135,the second point is the improvement of working conditions .
3136,health and safety at work is a priority in the Member States and must also become so in
3137,women 's policy must also be a criterion for the accession of candidate countries .
3138,the European Parliament could set a better example in this respect .
3139,I hope that the Sixth Framework Programme will no longer have to be as extensive
3140,this requires that women 's policy be taken more seriously over the next five years and

3149,thank you for the attention you gave me during our evening program together !

3154,"that is why I am particularly grateful that our rapporteur , Mr Lamassoure"

3328,I hope that this will work on the basis of the negotiations so far .
3329,I would like to raise a second issue .
3330,we are talking about coherence here .
3331,many colleagues have given examples of the extent to which the different policies are
3332,"but in my view , development policy as such also needs a little more coherence ."
3333,"it is not coherent if coordination with the Member States still does not work , if there"
3334,it is also not coherent with regard to the European taxpayer if we are implementing

3506,this takes the basis for a new computer program out of the hands of any developer .
3507,I believe that this makes it clear that the radiation directive is very critical and very contradic

3513,I am familiar with the argument that we would save that by the exchange rate mechanism .
3514,these slogans were also used when it came to the sugar market organisation .
3515,but am I correct in reading the press that the Council rejected this approach of the Commission at
3516,"I have interpreted the press report as saying that we do not support this , and I would"
3517,"otherwise , we will start a discussion here and discuss after the realities ."
3518,"I personally , at least , was extremely pleased with the Council 's involvement"
3519,"the problem we are discussing raises a second question , that of competition in the European Community"
3520,"liberalisation , that is , the abolition of monopolies , is one of the success stories"
3521,"in the field of telecommunications , we have seen that the reduction in costs"
3522,but here there is a very great danger .
3523,"we are in a situation where some are liberalising and opening up to competition , but others"
3524,"we can then see that those who have not done so sometimes even win with monopoly , as"
3525,the citizen will still be faced with a monopoly and will not benefit from the
3526,I believe that the Commission must take this fact more seriously in its future actions .
3527,the second point on which the Council has been somewhat reluctant is the question of retro

3529,it is therefore of the utmost importance that retrofitting of these vehicles should be encourage

3534,"thirdly , we can only achieve a better human being if we allow more self-determination"
3535,"we support the demand that a solution be found to the conflict between the US and the EU ,"
3536,"Mr President , I just wanted to raise one question ."
3537,yesterday 's Minutes state that we have debated the McNally report and that
3538,I just want to ask why this is necessary .
3539,I heard that there is something wrong with the documents .
3540,but that is not supposed to happen .
3541,"the report has been debated , we have had time to vote on it today , and I"
3542,the principle of the House was that we should vote as close to the debate as possible .
3543,"in my view , the EU path is often double-tracked , contradictory , difficult"
3544,such legal errors then multiply fifteen times in implementation .
3545,if we have enlargement very soon - which I very much hope - then there will be twi
3546,"that is not the industry , that is the consumers ."
3547,the local citizen has seen that Europe wants to help and is alive .
3548,"in preparation for today 's debate , I visited some of the damaged areas last"
3549,the destruction is enormous and the despair of the people is great .
3550,but the people are also drawing their hope for a new beginning from the overwhelming
3551,I therefore ask you :
3552,have you ever been in the South of Europe and tasted the tomatoes that thrive here
3553,they are unmistakable .
3554,"I think that we should also ensure , within the framework of European agricultural policy ,"
3555,"appropriate regulations must be laid down so that , if there are miscarria"
3556,"but one thing must be clear at the same time , and I think that would be a positive"
3557,the situation in Turkish prisons was one of the main points in the discussion I had with the
3558,it has become clear that the Turkish government believes that steps are needed to prevent further deaths .
3559,"in this context , the Commission welcomes the fact that the Turkish Parliament has already adopted an"
3560,the new regulations are intended to enable prisoners to participate in social activities within
3561,"we must appeal to Turkey today to ensure that the new rules are applied as soon as possible ,"
3562,it must be said that a lot has happened this year .
3563,"despite the monetary turmoil in other continents , the euro has already proved"
3564,I should also like to remind you that we still have very different systems in the beef
3565,"if the price falls below a certain margin , then at least the meat of male bo"
3566,and how is it actually from the ethical side ?
3567,"of course , it is a sad chapter if we now make EUR 700 million available"
3568,it is a sad chapter for agricultural policy and a sad chapter for the taxpayer
3569,but it must also be said that there is indeed no alternative on the table .
3570,"it is not about promoting a slaughter programme here , but about a necessary measure ,"
3571,"Madam Member , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a multilateral institution"
3572,two brief remarks : I believe that there should be no misunderstanding between us .
3573,I did not say that the media is blowing up the situation .
3574,"I said that sensationalistic reporting , in the specific case of information on the situation in"
3575,this was to be understood as an appeal to the media to impose a certain re

3577,"I was in Moldova a few days ago , and there the problem is on an even more alarm"
3578,the other is better cooperation in the field of police and justice .
3579,"Mr President , after so many questions have unfortunately remained open today , I would like"
3580,"I am against any discrimination , and I would like to show this by some examples :"
3581,"I am against any discrimination against homosexuality , but I am against the political attempts"
3582,"that marriage between persons of different sexes , which is the germ cell of society , is"
3583,I support what Mr Watson has said because Mr Swoboda is also confirming to the current

3588,this is about exemption rules that apply to the insurance industry in Europe .
3589,you all know that competition law has been one of the most important tasks of the European Union
3590,"in general , the objective of competition rules is to ensure that competition exists in the European"
3591,"this is good for consumers , it promotes technical progress and it prevents monopolies and"
3592,"therefore , there are strict rules here where the Commission must and can act ."
3593,"there are three areas of application of these rules , firstly agreements or cartels , which"
3594,"in all these matters , the Commission has repeatedly shown in recent years that it takes"
3595,the judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C 106 / 96
3596,"in addition , the new rules on financial management must be strictly observed for all programmes"
3597,"against this background , organisations that have been funded so far will only receive further funding"
3598,we must give Europol operational means of action without delay .
3599,we must now use the possible joint action teams .
3600,"wherever terrorists are being investigated , Europol must be present and promote the direct exchange"
3601,these opportunities already exist and we must seize them .
3602,"this is something that can be done within the framework of existing law , and we do"
3603,"to restore and strengthen consumer confidence , food safety and regulations must be taken into account"
3604,reliable risk assessment requires comprehensive analysis and reference measurements .
3605,"in order to make scientific results comparable across Europe , the measurement methods used must be standardised"
3606,for the investigation of foodstuffs or especially of toxic substances in animal feed
3607,the Institute for Health and Consumer Protection of the Joint Research Centre already carries out Europe-wide
3608,the talks in the United Nations framework took place in New York in December and in Geneva
3609,they will go into what may be the decisive third round in May .
3610,"negotiations are indeed to continue until a solution has been found , or at least until"
3611,I would like to make it clear that there is no Court of Justice ruling on this particular
3612,"it is true , however , that the Commission classifies this company , Coillte , as"

3614,"according to Article 2 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the Afforestation Regulation , this a"

3617,"overall , the rural development support scheme is very flexible , but its implementation is a matter"
3618,they are responsible for the priority given to supporting young farmers .
3619,it is unacceptable that asylum seekers are being rejected by the respective border author
3620,it is unacceptable that they run the risk of being returned to their persecuting state
3621,"their asylum applications must be examined by an independent authority in the Member State concerned ,"
3622,asylum seekers must be able to take legal action against negative administrative decisions .
3623,that is the minimum rule of law that we can demand of ourselves .
3624,"if that happens , however , we will of course have an immense need for LIFE-"
3625,"given this situation , where habitats must now be enforced by force , we clear"
3626,what we said here last week in an impressive session is still true today .
3627,"this morning , at the Conference of Presidents , I asked the High Representative , Javier Sol"
3628,let me raise a second point that struck me at the December Council .
3629,"if we take a position at first reading , which will be tomorrow with the final vote in"
3630,"he can wait until May , when the two parties have reached an agreement ."
3631,"however , in the interests of the safety of passengers in Europe , we cannot accept that"
3632,that is something that the Commission and we should be looking out for together .
3633,"secondly , the unemployment rate in the weak regions has not decreased significantly"
3634,"the record of this Presidency is problematic , above all , because it has not acted"
3635,this is especially visible in the process of the withdrawn old-timer vehicle regulation .
3636,"there , the Community was not served , and it was up to Mr Trittin to play"
3637,"at present , the work of aid organisations is severely restricted by the prevailing"
3638,"the arrival of UNAMSL forces , the UN mission in Sierra Leone , this month will"
3639,I consider it to be an important point that the possibility has been provided - as was the
3640,"ladies and gentlemen , the work is not yet finished , neither in our country"
3641,the preparations for accession will continue with energy and vigour in the coming year .
3642,"the Commission will keep a close eye on whether all commitments are being met and , as promise"
3643,"I would like to remind our President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , of the great"
3644,Europe cannot be built against women .
3645,we are the foremost institution with a 30 % share of women in the European Parliament
3646,"the Commission has 25 % women , which is at least an upward trend ."
3647,the ECJ could be better .
3648,only two of the fifteen judges at the ECJ are women .
3649,"yes , and the Council is very poor in terms of development policy in relation to gender equality"
3650,"however , this disaster can happen every day , Commissioner , because it has been the same game"
3651,the combination of an ancient scrap tanker and a flag of convenience - this time of
3652,"flag of convenience is synonymous with poor quality , poor ship , poor technology , poor"
3653,"usually , the result is an organized lack of responsibility , so that no one"

3655,"I do not want to give a wrong political impression , so I will go , although I"
3656,"for example , changes have recently been introduced in the social security and healthcare systems of Romania"
3657,"these are already considerable efforts , but they are not yet sufficient ."
3658,this is why the Commission is continuing to implement programmes to reform social security systems in the
3659,these programs are called Consensus 1 and Consensus
3660,they should continue in addition to the technical assistance that most of these countries have already received through national
3661,the proposal for a directive is a logical consequence of the European Union 's strategy
3662,you will see from the committee 's report that we agree with the strategy set out in the
3663,"but , agreeing on the strategy does not necessarily mean agreeing on the detail ."
3664,I believe that the committee 's report proposes important and necessary changes to the draft
3665,the concerns we are expressing today are not concerns that stem from a colonialist or
3666,this is not an issue of unlawful interference in the internal affairs of a third
3667,"no , as Commissioner Patten has repeatedly emphasised , we are talking about a"
3668,"therefore , it would be pointless to terminate these agreements ."
3669,"instead , we must use them to conduct this critical dialogue ."
3670,this also includes the consequent privatisation and restructuring of the economy .
3671,the banking and financial sectors must be fully reformed and fiscal consolidation should be continued .
3672,"the dialogue between the social partners , the other groups of civil society , the government and parliament plays"
3673,the differentiation of the economy must benefit small and medium-sized enterprises in particular
3674,"in the long term , Slovakia should earn its foreign exchange increasingly from sectors of the"
3675,"Commissioner , we will strengthen your reform proposal tomorrow with a broad majority ."
3676,"I believe that , with regard to this reform , we must insist at the end of this nego"
3677,"I would also like to say , however , that in future there must be fewer exceptions"
3678,the industry is therefore well advised to prepare for the fact that a follow-up regulation
3679,the objective of the Regulation should be to ensure the protection of animal and public health and to
3680,a peaceful solution to the Kurdish problem and respect for human rights is the better way to peace .
3681,do mothers always have to suffer ?
3682,can we not help to plant a flower garden of brotherhood and peace between the Kurdish and Turkish
3683,"I welcome the MEDA programme , which states that all forms of state , legal , political"
3684,the allocation of EU financial resources to Turkey should be linked to the solution of the Kurdish question
3685,"I have the impression that these remarks by Mr Berlusconi were very genuine ,"
3686,"Furthermore , Mr President-in-Office , the Socialist Group in this House believes"
3687,"Italy therefore has a European responsibility , and we have a duty of solidarity with your"
3688,when the supplementary and amending budget was presented to us - and I have to agree
3689,we must not try to hide such an important and central area for the future of the European Union
3690,this would make it clear that we do not want parliamentary control or parliamentary follow-up
3691,this is not acceptable .
3692,we have said this from the very beginning and we will continue to view it as such and follow
3693,"Commissioner , we also believe that it is necessary to establish a link with the readi"
3694,"in committee , we have explicitly adopted an amendment which does not impose"
3695,the first concerns the voting during the April part-session .
3696,"the Committee on Budgetary Control has two options : firstly , to propose granting discharge"
3697,"if , in the second case , the plenary rejected the proposal , discharge would be"
3698,"this is an implicit vote which , in my view , does not in any way reflect"
3699,what would then remain of an originally stringent decision that would have to be adapted to
3700,"is the closure of the accounts still correct in this case , now that , unlike"
3701,"I do not want to go into all the details , but I believe that it is also of"
3702,"to avoid this legal uncertainty and the confusion that it will cause , the rapport"
3703,"a general ban on the castration of pigs , as some have called for , would not"
3704,to what extent the double vaccination of male animals will replace surgical castration will be reveal
3705,"but in my opinion , it would be the more feasible way ."
3706,"the wording that has been found , that women can return to their own workplace or an"
3707,"however , we have problems with the definition of sexual harassment ."
3708,"we have found a rather vague wording here , because I think that is not the way"
3709,"in this context , however , it should also be pointed out that we currently have a different"
3710,"the nations are responsible for the systems , for the relationship between the pillars , for"
3711,"the European level is responsible for the internal market , for mobility , for cross-border"
3712,"we therefore support greater coordination , but not excluding politics and the European Parliament ,"
3713,"coordination , yes , but with the participation of those responsible for political decisions"
3714,"those affected believe that they have an advantage , but they only harm themselves and"
3715,"now , by nature and by definition , undeclared work is difficult to detect in all countries"
3716,long-term studies and estimates suggest that there are 28 million undeclared workers
3717,the volume of undeclared work now amounts to 15 % of the EU'
3718,the entire sector is growing three times faster than the official economy .
3719,we see this as being in line with the Commission 's transport policy objectives .
3720,"in the White Paper on transport , which we will then discuss , it promises us that it"
3721,we want all of that too .
3722,that is why it is so important that there is no gap between the entry into force of the

3724,"the Danish Presidency , in its efforts to reach a compromise between all the parties involved at"
3725,I think that is not the way to go .
3726,it is about us making transport policy .
3727,"politics is about making decisions on how the market can and should function , but within certain frame"
3728,that is what has happened here .
3729,"I will not now list the bird species affected by this , which could be preserved"
3730,but I think it is important to mention that non-intensive farming - and I would
3731,"I believe that if we do not recognize what farmers are doing today , we are not"
3732,"we will therefore vote in favour of this report , but in those areas where we believe"
3733,"what is extremely problematic , however , is that the European Parliament has been bypassed"
3734,"since this is not the first time that this has happened , but since this approach sometimes seems to"
3735,there must no longer be any such circumvention of the Treaty .
3736,I would like to follow up on the demand that Parliament be more closely involved in the ad

3738,it is necessary to recognize the political-parliamentary and socio-economic difference

3740,"it was possible thanks to the rigorous , but nevertheless compromise-oriented ,"
3741,the result is impressive .
3742,but integrating China into world trade also means enabling it to observe and apply the rules of

3745,progress has been made in the economic field .
3746,"after three years of recession , the economy is growing again ."
3747,"among the Central and Eastern European candidate countries , the Czech Republic has the second highest per"
3748,"as a result of a smart tax policy , foreign direct investments amounted to more than"
3749,there were also positive developments in the privatisation of the banking sector .
3750,the Commission stated in its review of the Court of Auditors ' report in the middle of
3751,"after a thorough examination of this issue , it became clear that fundamental reform is necessary"
3752,"in any case , a geographic information system is required ."
3753,"since the conditions for such a reform were not yet in place in 2001,"
3754,the Court 's proposals also highlighted further opportunities for improvement in this area .
3755,"following very constructive discussions with the Member States , these improvements were then incorporated"
3756,Reflections are currently under way on the future of these policies .
3757,the Commission 's proposals on the future of regional policy will be presented at the end
3758,it would therefore be premature to decide at this stage on the way in which mountain areas
3759,"Madam President , on Amendment No 13 , I have nothing against this procedure of"
3760,we are dealing with an amendment which was also tabled as an oral amend
3761,"this oral amendment by Mr Skinner is not included here , nor is there a statement"
3762,this applies to the German version .
3763,"while the reasoning is correct again , it is not correctly presented in the original German"
3764,I would ask that we vote on what we have decided in committee .
3765,"incidentally , the English version seems to me to be correct ."
3766,"that is why we appeal to the Attorney General , Mr Ustinov , to carry"
3767,"we recall the case of Alexander Nikitin , where the review took sixteen months , and"
3768,"he doesn ’ t even have windows in his cell , and that in winter ."
3769,Gregori Pasko does not want pardon .
3770,I would like to point out to the Commissioner that there is some strange false information circula
3771,it is not about a confession of guilt .
3772,he is right !
3773,he is entitled to use the free word .
3774,I would therefore ask the Commissioner to tell Mr Patten that this issue must finally become part
3775,"the generation of politicians of the 1950s - Adenauer , Monnet"
3776,"however , I believe that the path that Parliament is now asking the Council to take is ,"
3777,I believe that all the Member States of the United Nations know where the European Union stands .
3778,"if we now only call for a moratorium , we will not lose sight of the"
3779,"nevertheless , I think it would be good if the European Union as a whole put forward"
3780,I do not think it would be good if one or the other government were to stand in the
3781,much of what the Commission is proposing in its communication as follow-up to the assessment
3782,it is only a pity that expert opinions count more than the opinions of Members
3783,especially in the light of the current low-level pro-European sentiment among the citizens of
3784,the other side is the potential that contributes to the growth of the European identity that is so
3785,a Commission communication on this is still pending .
3786,"as rapporteur for the 1998 budget , I can already announce that in the"
3787,"this Parliament has a political task which , in the conciliation procedure between the Council and Parliament"
3788,I consider it irresponsible to make “ working documents ” publicly available here .
3789,official documents and working documents are two different pairs of shoes !
3790,"the conciliation procedure , in particular , is about the political assertion of different position"
3791,"if all the ideas set out in working documents are made public in advance , we can stop our"
3792,the Council will be pleased to know all of Parliament ’ s intentions in advance .

3802,"perhaps this is one way , albeit only the second best ."
3803,"maybe it takes a next stage , where you then get on with the best way ."
3804,"( de ) Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report ."
3805,may I ask why there is a change in the voting order ?
3806,we have Amendment No 430 on the European Year of Languages as the

3814,"we accuse you of acting illegally , of breaking the law ."
3815,you are breaking the Treaty and you are breaking existing legislation !
3816,we will consolidate some of the existing provisions in the area of foreign policy under head
3817,but we will also master the new challenges .

3827,"this is not something we can do overnight , but it is something we really need to get"
3828,this requires a major European debate .
3829,"you yourself – and I agree with you , Mr President of the Commission – have said that"
3830,I would imagine that you would also make proposals from your point of view on how you en
3831,the Commission must have a leading role .
3832,"in this connection , Mr President , I would like to mention that some of the members of your"

3846,"I simply have to say , Madam Vice-President , that just a few years ago – in"
3847,the Energy Council has even officially decided this .
3848,and then the different actual conditions in the Member States must also be taken into account .
3849,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
3850,I think that Mr Swoboda 's proposals for the Council regulation are appropriate
3851,I believe that the regulation would gain from this .
3852,I would also like to expressly thank him for the explanation he has given and I
3853,the situation in recent weeks and months has far from improved .
3854,a delegation from our group recently visited Turkey and returned with appalling reports from
3855,I do not want to expand on that here .
3856,"this false assumption , which is still widespread because the exchange rate between the euro ,"
3857,"the intrinsic value of money is decisive , and here we have historically recorded"
3858,it is good that the European Parliament 's monetary dialogue with the European Central Bank makes it
3859,"the fundamental problems of modulation also remain , even if the cuts are set at a low"
3860,reducing aid through modulation will result in an unreasonable reduction in
3861,"for our farmers , the amount of 7500 euros is too low ."
3862,I have therefore tabled an amendment to increase this amount to EUR 10
3863,"otherwise , practically all Luxembourg farmers would suffer income losses of up to 2"
3864,"Madam President-in-Office , the open forum is not an alternative to the Convention ."
3865,"it can serve as a preparatory measure , but the Convention – made up of parliamentarians"
3866,that is why this is a building on the public process and not an alternative to the public process
3867,"critically , we would like to note that the proposed or listed qualification deficits"
3868,"as socialists , we want to give all workers the chance to take advantage of mobility"
3869,"we must , however , also offer them these opportunities ."
3870,"the new labour market must not be open only to special small groups , but it must be open"
3871,"I therefore think that we need creative ideas and solutions from the Commission , not just a list"
3872,we also need a study that looks more closely at the possible disruptions to the labour
3873,I think that the Commission has put forward a proposal with many good ideas .
3874,"the document offers many good approaches , but it can certainly be improved ."
3875,one area where the Committee on the Environment has made improvements is the mandatory warnings in
3876,"it is important that consumers are made much more aware , and that this information should be manda"
3877,it is scientifically proven that the risk of death from sudden infant death syndrome is five times higher
3878,"the United States Environmental Protection Agency has calculated that 5,000 cancer deaths are"
3879,"that means that there are far more deaths than those caused by environmental poisons , which we"
3880,I know that the area of food safety is also being looked at with particular attention here in
3881,"therefore , with regard to food safety , the necessary measures will be taken by February"
3882,"the number is relatively small , however , and one should not assume that if some farms"
3883,"however , financial support for Turkey , in order to support those forces which want to move closer"
3884,we therefore also find the TDI 's idea of setting up a sort of council of

3886,the fact that this motion has been produced as a compromise between the four major groups clear
3887,the Commission should follow this example so that it can remain credible in its handling of European tax
3888,I must point out that the decisions taken in Berlin would allow for a 6.1
3889,"that means that there is still a great deal of negotiation to be done , and"
3890,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament and the rapporteurs , Mrs Haug ,"
3891,"I would also like to thank the Council , and in particular for the brilliant performance – Mrs"
3892,"Mr President , I can understand the rapporteur 's question very well ."
3893,"on the other hand , it is simply a matter of a different legal assessment of the relevan"
3894,we believe that our proposal is clearer on this point .
3895,"however , it does not really matter which of the two amendments is adopted ."
3896,I therefore ask that we vote on the Liberals ' motion first and then on our
3897,"we believe that , including the oral amendment , we have a somewhat clearer proposal"
3898,"but there is no war on either side , depending on what is assumed ."
3899,the European Parliament is a co-legislator and we must ensure that careful work is
3900,"we still have many opportunities at first reading , but we must also keep possibilities open for second"
3901,"I therefore ask for your support , but I also ask the Legal Service and our rapporteurs"
3902,"however , the future will show whether this pharmaceutical legislation will be easier"
3903,I thank all those who have taken part and hope that we will succeed in this great work
3904,it is not that this was a case of a country that is not in the OSCE and
3905,"yet he is overwhelming the media , and anyone who has a different opinion is subject"
3906,"I think we must protest strongly here , and it is clear that normal relations with the European"
3907,another point is the substance bans .
3908,I believe that the Commission should pay close attention to ensuring that sustainability is demonstra
3909,it is important to avoid the situation where substance bans increase consumption and costs in certain areas

3911,a patent would protect these people from companies using their invention without paying the inventors a
3912,"we are not satisfied , not all of us , we know that !"
3913,nor can the Commission be satisfied that the SAPARD funds have not flowed in the

3915,we must also make it clear to these candidate countries that this is not just about the quality they

3917,"the apology of some candidate countries , that we do not export anything to the EU at the"
3918,we cannot allow this to happen .
3919,we need money and quick help .
3920,money that is now spent on SAPARD and other programmes in the candidate countries will save
3921,let 's try to make the best of it !
3922,it is good that state aid has been reduced again .
3923,this is the result of the Commission 's strong aid control policy .
3924,"this is because , not only does this aid pose the risk of market distortions ,"
3925,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very happy ."
3926,"in contrast to the previous speaker , I would like to say quite clearly that this White Paper"
3927,the people living along the transit routes are desperate .
3928,many of them are farmers whose families have lived on their farms for centu

3930,I beg you not to take away all hope from these people !
3931,"thirdly , food safety ."
3932,"one thing is clear , the fish processing industry is not the cause , but the victim of har"
3933,it cannot therefore bear the burden alone .
3934,it cannot be the purpose of consumer protection to set limit values according to the motto :
3935,"reliable and toxicologically secure limit values are useful , but not quick"
3936,"I would like to write this down in the pedigree book , especially for the Member States ."
3937,"finally , I would like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of our group for his"
3938,I think we can look forward to Mr Byrne 's reply .
3939,"this brings me to the last proposal , namely the immediate measures for scrapping"
3940,our proposal is to set up a scrapping fund .
3941,this is an immediate measure .
3942,"this is not a permanent approach , but an immediate measure to help us re-establish"
3943,the fund is intended to supplement the funds already provided for in the Structural Fund for
3944,this funding and the new fund will provide financial support for the decommissioning of fi

3946,there is a certain amount of business in this area which is carried out in a grey
3947,we therefore call for registration of those who engage in such intermediary activities and believe that a
3948,my request - whether you respond to it as a citizen or as a member of a
3949,"there are animal welfare organisations in Greece , and I also know that they catch the dog"
3950,I believe that these organizations need money and the support of a citizen .
3951,"if he happens to be a minister , it does not hurt !"
3952,"indeed , France has the right to ban animal meal for domestic reasons ."
3953,but what may be right for France in this situation may not be right for all Member States .
3954,it is good that we are holding to the joint decisions of 1997
3955,a partially functional recycling system was ruined because of the failure to respect the safety
3956,"I say it openly , what we will be calling for in the resolution tomorrow – a"
3957,"however , parts of animals that are approved for human consumption must also be able to be used"
3958,"my group leader , Mr Poettering , mentioned Richard Perle ."

3962,the second point I would like to make is that I do not think it is very fair to
3963,we have thus been obliged to continue to take account of the decisions taken by the

3973,"I will be brief , because most of it has already been said , but not by me ."
3974,"the situation in Peru is worrying , similar to that in Paraguay ."
3975,"however , it must be said that what we have now experienced in Peru is nothing new ."
3976,"for years now , the President of Peru has not been acting according to the rules of the"
3977,"I would therefore not only send an observer delegation to Peru , but I would also recommend"
3978,"I would like to focus on one point in particular , namely the question of evaluation :"
3979,I can already tell you that the evaluation in 2003 will be based on
3980,"firstly , as every year , a so-called gender scoreboard will be drawn"
3981,this work involves both the evaluation of the framework strategy 2001-
3982,a preliminary report on these activities is scheduled for the end of 2003
3983,"when we , as Parliament , speak out in favour of a limited revision of the financial perspective"
3984,but here too we have said that we want to support this .
3985,"we have tabled an amendment aimed at reducing this period to two years ,"
3986,we then noticed that you had presented us with the explanations of this comit
3987,"the third important area is the WEU , external security ."
3988,we have experienced in the Kosovo conflict what it means not to have one 's own information
3989,that is why we should keep this option open when the WEU is integrated into the EU
3990,a foreign and security policy of its own also means having its own information resources .
3991,"we should not close ourselves to this path from the outset , but always keep an"
3992,I abstained from voting on the PPE / Verts / ALE resolution on the
3993,I see it as positive that there is something to oppose the British parliamentary decision .
3994,it is emphasised that the European Parliament stands by its decision to ban cloning (
3995,"we regret that products from genetically engineered animals will not be subject to labelling , but"
3996,"even if the Commission does not reflect the majorities that emerged from the European elections ,"
3997,the restructuring of the portfolios also suggests greater efficiency and transparency in
3998,"however , in the interests of the citizens , we will scrutinise every single Commissioner ."
3999,but it is a hearing and not a questioning .
4000,we need credible representatives for a strong Commission .
4001,but we urgently need the necessary information for this .
4002,it is necessary that the findings of the Second Report of the Council of Wise Men
4003,"otherwise , a new crisis between Parliament and the Commission is inevitable ."
4004,delays in the appointment of the Commission are not in the interests of the citizens either
4005,"Mr Stockmann has said so much that is right , namely that the main objective ,"
4006,"Mr Stockmann , if you vote with us tomorrow in favour of the Commission proposal ,"
4007,"I can understand that you do not want to hurt your Austrian rapporteur , but you"
4008,vote for the Commission 's proposal !
4009,"thirdly , and finally , I would like to remind you that it has been accepted since"
4010,the numerical disadvantage is more than offset by the advantage of greater influence in
4011,"in conclusion , I would like to say that , with your report , Mr Varela , you"
4012,the Commission will certainly take their thoughts into account as much as possible in its forthcoming
4013,"I am very pleased , Commissioner , that you and the Commission have recently introduced the State"
4014,this was a joint demand from Parliament .
4015,"this scoreboard , which is in its infancy , can , in my view , become an"
4016,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
4017,some Members have asked specific questions .
4018,I would like to ask Mrs Wallström once again to give a specific response to this .
4019,"firstly , the question of when sector-specific reduction plans with timetables from the Commission"
4020,then there is of course the question of your position on a directive on the feeding of
4021,I would be very grateful if you could give us some concrete comments on these three points
4022,"I do not know whether you , who are so new in office , are already doing that ."
4023,we all agree that we should do something to protect the environment .
4024,"one year ago today , the serious accident at Lake Constance occurred ."
4025,"this is not directly related to this regulation , but it is an indication that many airspace"
4026,that means that it is our responsibility to ensure that we create safety and efficiency .
4027,let me mention two other aspects that go beyond Barcelona .
4028,"firstly , the reform of the Council ."
4029,"Mr President-in-Office of the European Council , in January you said that you were in"
4030,we have information that this is to be stopped at a certain level - not at political level
4031,"we would like to encourage you to implement this institutional working group at political level , including by"
4032,"if we achieve good results in Seville , that will be to the credit of the Spanish Presiden"
4033,that is our all advantage .
4034,animal feed is still under criticism and will remain so until we have open declaration and through
4035,"it cannot be the case that we destroy valuable substances for fear of fraud , improp"
4036,"that is why I believe that the efforts to ensure openness , control and truthfulness"
4037,"for that long , the ban on feeding meat and bone meal to omnivores"
4038,I would like to explain this rejection in terms of the subject .
4039,the first is the deletion of references to a purely customs regime and the automatic
4040,"to be clear , the main purpose of our proposal is to bring the COM for bananas into"
4041,the most important element of the proposal is the introduction of the customs regime after a certain transition
4042,"however , this will require an agreement with the interested parties on the administration of the tariff quota"
4043,the Commission proposal aims to ensure that a credit institution and its subsidiary in another Member State can
4044,this is what this proposal for a directive ensures .
4045,"Mrs Schreyer , this transfer took place despite the explicit warnings from this House"
4046,Parliament then pulled the emergency brake and put the additional posts envisaged for the current
4047,it is now in the hands and responsibility of the Commission to remove the barriers described
4048,only on this condition does it make sense to lift the current reserve .
4049,we are in the third year of the Financial Perspective .
4050,some of the things we have to do together here are almost household work – that has to be
4051,this is the third year in which we have put the budget together .
4052,"I think that we can indeed be satisfied with the result again , it is in"
4053,"on behalf of the Commission , I would like to thank all those involved once again ."
4054,I will mention a few points that will be important to us .
4055,it is good that the Commission is taking a more aggressive approach to the issue of arre
4056,Commissioner Schreyer has just given a few figures on this .
4057,"but we will also have to ensure that payments for new commitments are processed quickly ,"
4058,we also agree with this House that the issues of control must be a cornerstone in the area
4059,"I must , however , also reiterate the Commission 's position that it cannot assume sole"
4060,it is the Member States – and this is in line with our basic structure in the European Union
4061,"in exercising their sovereign rights as flag States , they must provide the necessary human ,"
4062,increased research into labelled vaccines against animal diseases will be made possible within the
4063,"Mr Mulder , you have convinced the Commission of your proposals ."
4064,I am confident that you will also succeed in convincing the Council .
4065,"in any case , I would like to appeal to the Council , because this is compulsory"
4066,that would be neither justified in terms of content nor in keeping with the good spirit
4067,that is why I would like to see not only a well-meaning letter from our President
4068,that is the purpose of this oral question and the accompanying resolution that is being discussed
4069,the second area that is important to me is the aftercare area .
4070,we must mention mine clearance programmes and pay particular attention to humanitarian actions .
4071,"in particular , research initiatives in this area should be supported , especially those focusing on"
4072,"we should not , however , neglect the fact that the European Union , and in particular"
4073,the Commission has set very strict deadlines for the licence periods and the transitional arrangements
4074,I think that we in the committee have found a fair compromise between the various stakeholders
4075,I would like to see a start on the introduction of licensing systems throughout Europe .
4076,"we will be able to discuss this in further steps , Commissioner , in order to make it even"
4077,the current situation is not satisfactory .
4078,the Commissioner himself presented an EU statistic which states that at present some countries are extremely affect
4079,"Austria ranks at the top of this statistic , with almost five asylum applications per thousand"
4080,"if you compare these statistics , you will see that Austria has 50 times as many"
4081,"please therefore understand this initiative , which can only be welcomed because it should lead to"
4082,because what is happening now and the time we need now are unsustainable .
4083,"for example , if a group dismisses a staff member , that staff member will hold Parliament"
4084,or that accrued and carried-over leave entitlements of group staff have
4085,I would therefore warn against creating such a situation through fake conflicts .
4086,"if we want to avoid this situation , we have the opportunity to find a solution at the for"
4087,but if in the end a situation should actually arise in which the current state of affairs
4088,"as you know , the Commission proposed a year ago to limit fishing effort in the context"
4089,"the Council has not yet taken a decision on this , and developments have not stopped in"
4090,"Parliament , after all , issued its opinion on this recovery plan on 13 June this"
4091,"I would like to make one final , very personal comment ."
4092,anyone who believes that he can achieve environmental protection with the CO2 tax will find no
4093,"I am quoting the Secretary-General of the IAEA , who recently told us all that"
4094,"that is why I consider all CO2 considerations , until proved otherwise , to be"
4095,"finally , a huge challenge : enlargement ."
4096,I believe that enlargement also represents a huge opportunity for small businesses .
4097,but let us not be afraid to give them the necessary help .
4098,it is only a few years away .
4099,"many are already there , many are interested , and I believe that the work at the grassroot"
4100,"this is where we in the European Parliament see the challenge of committing ourselves , of"
4101,"on the question of a satisfactory transit arrangement to and from Kaliningrad , the former König"
4102,I am not satisfied with how this is actually going .
4103,"it has happened , as I have warned several times :"
4104,"in practice , there are complications for travellers and more bureaucracy , and there is"
4105,"this cannot be in the interests of either party involved , and with Belarus , which is Lithuania"
4106,we do not agree on the possibilities for employees to participate .
4107,there is a reason for this .
4108,"the reason is that we have different systems in all countries , even though we have the same head"
4109,"I therefore say my opinion : I say yes to an internal market for financial services , yes"
4110,I therefore also advocate that supplementary pension schemes which include biometric risks offer
4111,"it is therefore important to recognise that , in the field of audiovisual content"
4112,the cross-border distribution of European works is still too low .
4113,"in cinemas , the market share of American films is 80 % , and that of European"
4114,"in television , the American share of imports of feature films and series is 74 % , that"
4115,"Madam President , Mr Swoboda ’ s question about reactor safety prompted me to ask whether"
4116,I believe that this is not entirely clear in all areas in all our institutions .
4117,perhaps this should be clarified again next year .
4118,"have the murders , the expulsions , the looting and the arson in Kosovo stoppe"
4119,"unfortunately , not ."
4120,"unfortunately , the crimes continue , with two differences ."
4121,"firstly , the victims of the crimes are no longer the Kosovars of Albanian origin"
4122,"secondly , it is no longer the Yugoslav army that is in Kosovo , but our"
4123,who is to blame ?
4124,"unfortunately , those for whom the international community has waged a war , the first war"
4125,the former KLA - I say ' former ' because it is said to have ceased to
4126,and that is the shame !
4127,"in this difficult environment , the European Central Bank is doing an excellent job ."
4128,"however , it must continue to do everything possible to ensure that it does not discredit the trust"
4129,we therefore welcome their policy of a calm hand and encourage them to continue with it .
4130,"however , I would like to question whether last week ’ s rate cut fits into this frame"
4131,what do we need to do to promote this ?
4132,firstly - and I would like to thank Mr Seppänen for this - we in the
4133,the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats will
4134,"given the particular sensitivity of the subject , the adoption of the report will provok"
4135,"the report makes substantial demands on the governments of the candidate countries , which have not"
4136,I firmly believe that such an approach is in no way conducive to promoting confidence
4137,"secondly , I do not want to make our lives so easy ."
4138,"when we point our fingers at the Americans , we must not forget that a number"
4139,it is not that the Europeans have done their homework .
4140,we know that CO2 emissions are increasing in our country and we have discussed this here
4141,the question is : do we need a global agreement to start reducing emissions at home ?
4142,I would remind the Commission of its communication on emissions trading and of the Hague Conference
4143,"my question is : are you prepared to do something like that , to present something like that"
4144,what is preventing us from starting emissions trading within the European Union in 200
4145,"when this discharge procedure began last December with the Court of Auditors ' report , I point"
4146,"in fact , two aspects also point in this direction , namely the relatively small number of"
4147,"as for the second part of your question , I can say that the Member States are interested in"
4148,"so , you are right , on the one hand it is of course the Finance Ministers who"
4149,"on the one hand , we have the forecast and the huge discrepancy with what"
4150,"agreement was also reached between Parliament , the Council and the Commission on the notification documents for export"
4151,the exporter shall then keep the notification documents and the acknowledgement of receipt
4152,he is also obliged to send this documentation to the authority of the Member State from which
4153,the Commission then makes these documents available to the public in accordance with EU rules on access to
4154,"on the human rights issue in Nigeria , the EU has drawn up a common position , draf"
4155,I mention this development in the year 2000 after the elections because it shows that
4156,we have already come a long way .
4157,"we must consistently continue what was started in May and July , up to a European agreement"
4158,Croatia and the region deserve it in the interests of European peace .
4159,and for two reasons .
4160,the first reason is prevention .
4161,I was in Banja Luka a few days ago at a conference of our group .
4162,"there were encouraging things to see , the Serbian opposition , which is really in a pleasant"
4163,"but I also met a man who sat there , stammering with fear , and reca"
4164,"I found the conversation quite interesting , because it was somewhat like saying that if he had known"
4165,I therefore ask you to make it clear to these citizens in the resolution we are signalling
4166,you will therefore see - and I would like to thank all the Members of the Committee
4167,that is the reason for this resolution .
4168,I would be pleased if these proposals from the Committee on Regional Policy could be taken into
4169,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much ."
4170,"under the auspices of Mr Chichester , a report on this subject has been presented"
4171,it is a good report .
4172,the European Union also promotes environmental policy in the field of energy through programmes that promote the
4173,anyone who knows me knows that I am an angry opponent of all kind
4174,I am not an additional member of the Committee on Budgetary Control for nothing .
4175,it is clear that Korea is under-offering itself and is sliding into its own ruin if
4176,"young girls are particularly at risk in Africa , more than in Europe , for example ."
4177,"nowhere are there more teenage mothers , nowhere do they have more infected babies"
4178,the President-in-Office will certainly also comment on the disaster fund in a moment
4179,"nevertheless , I would like to say once again that we are in a special situation here"
4180,if we really succeed in establishing all the legal bases for this new instrument by the end
4181,"Mr President , I would like to join Mrs Lulling in her comments ."
4182,I would like to say that Mr Haarder has made an exemplary effort to reach a consens
4183,that is why his report is much better than all the previous ones .
4184,"nevertheless , I voted against this report , along with the majority of my group ,"
4185,"the German Basic Law places marriage and the family under the special protection of the constitution , and this"
4186,"this , on the other hand , is a guarantee of human rights ."
4187,"marriage and family are the basis of human rights , as is the right to life ."
4188,I therefore believe that these points should have been omitted from the report on human rights .
4189,"this report on human rights would then have been unanimously approved in this House , because"

4232,my second question concerns border protection : what do you think of a separate European legal basis for

4313,you should not underestimate this .
4314,"now , I sometimes hear that a democratic process in the traditional sense is not possible in Europe"
4315,"certainly , there is no European public and no European public opinion of the quality that exists"
4316,but that should not prevent us from strengthening the principles of democracy at European level .
4317,the reunification of Europe is a historic opportunity and Czechs and Germans in particular look
4318,I very much welcome the fact that the rapporteur is trying to propose a way of making the
4319,we will strongly support these proposals by the rapporteur .

4321,"I do not want to bore you with details – time limits for implementation , the requirement"
4322,"Furthermore , we must also consider whether it is right – and we have just had cases"

4324,I would like to remind you that under the Spanish Presidency the EU spoke with one voice
4325,that was the good experience .
4326,the Committee on Transport and Tourism has incorporated its position on the Rack report into the Bro
4327,"as a Social Democrat , I would like to emphasise three points ."
4328,"firstly , we need a more ambitious transport infrastructure programme for the accession countries ."
4329,"we therefore believe that the Financial Perspective is not sufficient , because the gap between"
4330,"however , development periods of more than 50 years are politically unacceptable ."
4331,"however , I would also like to see regions have the opportunity to find appropriate additions"
4332,"on this point , I would not agree with the report before us ."
4333,all these paternalistic ideas you are developing here ignore the fact that you do not
4334,"this concept of thematic information and promotion measures , which complement national and regional measures ,"
4335,the basic question is
4336,: can one make politics with the budget ?
4337,can things be put in reserve to achieve political objectives ?
4338,"and we do this in many places , Mr Walter ."
4339,we are doing this in Afghanistan because we have said that there are some things that are not being
4340,we have the impression that the Commission underestimates the importance of the fight against drugs .
4341,please provide us with information about what you are doing and then we will release the money .
4342,"Mrs Gill 's budget is full of reserves , with which we want to get the administration"
4343,"in this respect , the budget is already a means of making Parliament 's political objectives"
4344,"as chairman of the committee , I always tried to be fair to all Member States , strict but"
4345,so let me say something about some of the points :
4346,"yes , Mr Trakatellis and others are right , Mr Staes !"
4347,we have no live animal tests yet .
4348,"we do not yet have tests for very early infection , and the Commission is therefore called"
4349,of course we need it .
4350,that would be a very good thing and would eliminate the consequences of such a terrible discrimina
4351,one last sentence : I would like to distance myself from paragraph 18 of the resolution .
4352,it is not acceptable that Member States are asked to cover the costs of caring for people
4353,I believe that it is up to the Member States – within the framework of the principle of
4354,"I will , of course , vote in favour of the report , but I have made sure"
4355,"a particularly acute problem is cluster bombs , which cause such terrible injuries , even"
4356,"the Members who have spoken before me have described this , and I would like to"
4357,you are all familiar with the descriptions of the horrific injuries caused by the use
4358,what is particularly bad is that the fragments of cluster bombs that remain in a human
4359,not only are these bombs indiscriminate because they can hit both civilians and soldiers
4360,"this makes it impossible to accurately target military targets , and thus increases the risk"
4361,"ultimately , these bombs also seem indiscriminate in terms of time , since if they"
4362,the Commission report now before us still shows weaknesses in the implementation of the directiv
4363,it is actually very sad for a society to have to find that this particular area needs such increased
4364,I therefore support the request for the directive to be revised as soon as possible .
4365,"however , we will not be able to do so by the end of the year 20"
4366,"Mr Silva , I regret to have to say that we are not in agreement on"
4367,"firstly , as regards the Association Council , there was complete agreement between the Member States and"
4368,"there were no oppositions here , but a common position ."
4369,I should like to add that I presented the proposal on behalf of my colleague
4370,"we also say that when we talk about these problems , we must first of all put people at"
4371,we are saying quite clearly that the life and human dignity of a Christian and a non

4373,I think it is also very important that all those who welcome restructuring on the revenue

4375,that is not what it is all about .
4376,it is about naming a tax that will flow wholly or partly into the European budget
4377,"I can only emphasise what Mrs Haug said , that the real question is : with"
4378,the European Parliament must approve the accession treaties .
4379,"we are committed to greater openness and transparency in the negotiations , and"
4380,then people will put their concerns aside and support the great project of enlarging the

4382,so that we can finally come to the point where the tasks of the High Representative will

4384,we have experienced some disappointment .

4386,"we , the European Parliament , have already drawn a conclusion from this by intensifying and institution"
4387,"we must recognise that , with Amsterdam , the Petersberg tasks of WEU have"
4388,"on the other hand , however , it is of course primarily about security issues ."
4389,I believe that what is not working is that we are now simply shifting all security issues to
4390,everyone must assume his responsibility in this respect .
4391,"the national authorities have to do this , just as we have to assume our responsibilities ,"
4392,I can only support your further concerns that we must take into account the sensitivity of
4393,"I can assure you , Mrs Graeber Inselmann , that the Community"
4394,"in our communication on the reform of the common fisheries policy , we made it clear that"
4395,"as for the other conditions , they are not at our discretion or at our disposal ."
4396,the candidates are free to determine the pace of the process .
4397,"neither should any of you be surprised if the negotiators , the Prime Ministers"
4398,you should not forget that these people represent interests .
4399,I would be very surprised if they didn ’ t put pressure on them .
4400,they are there to put pressure on .

4404,this communication and the report on the communication are part of this Parliament 's reports on tele
4405,"I would like to mention the report by Mrs Thors , which will be voted on in"
4406,this is also the view that has to do with the European Parliament .
4407,"the European Parliament wants to be fully involved in this policy , as it is set out in"
4408,"this means that civil crisis management is also the budgetary responsibility of the European Parliament and ,"
4409,"the order for action is also a national responsibility , because each country decides sovereignly"
4410,"I find the question of when such a set of rules will actually come into force very interesting ,"
4411,"reading the text of the Committee on the Environment , one might think that every road in the country"
4412,"that is certainly far too vague , and what the Council is proposing is simply boring"
4413,if you are to draw up such a noise map only for 6 million cars a year
4414,so a good average would be a good solution in my opinion .
4415,"the question arises , what role can a specialised committee play if the Committee on Budgets"
4416,what role are the technical committees supposed to play then ?
4417,I am afraid that legal protection in this European Union will be further restricted .
4418,it is only clear who is responsible for this .
4419,"we should not run the risk of reducing legal protection in the European Union , especially when we"
4420,so little money has been spent on implementation aid for the accession countries that a
4421,"overall , I call this an extremely sad result for the good management of the Commission'"
4422,these aspects will certainly be reflected in Parliament 's discharge report .
4423,one has to imagine what is going on down there .
4424,"Ingushetia currently has more refugees than its own population , without humanitarian aid on"
4425,"in Kosovo there was humanitarian aid , but here there is nothing ."
4426,that is the situation .
4427,the partnership and cooperation agreement must therefore be suspended immediately .
4428,Russia must be excluded from the G8 summit and its government must not receive any more
4429,"Mr President , I agree with Mr Cashman ."
4430,"for eight years , the Russian military has been waging war against the civilian population in"
4431,that is the reality that we cannot turn a blind eye to .
4432,"I therefore ask you , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , if you have"
4433,did you actually present the threats of adopting resolutions against Russia to Mr Ivanov ?
4434,was this really at the centre of the agenda or was it just a side note ?
4435,the fact is that it has not done anything so far .
4436,I have the impression that this has not been explained to the Russian side with the seriousness
4437,"the permanent subsidisation of wind , biomass and solar energy is a mistake and pure symbol"

4447,I would like to highlight three points here :
4448,"firstly , the Convention establishes a good system for monitoring and controlling fishing activities in"

4455,"however , there must be no discounts in the fulfilment of the Maastricht criteri"
4456,only those countries that meet the criteria as they have been applied so far can introduce the euro
4457,there must be no discounts here either .

4459,the Charter sets out important fundamental rights .
4460,"in its present form , it does not meet the requirements of social justice that I advocate on"
4461,the right to work and the right to housing are not included .
4462,"Likewise , the social obligation of property is missing ."
4463,it is already assumed that the Charter could be the basis for a European Constitution .
4464,all the more so is the anchoring of fundamental social rights .
4465,so what are the changes compared to last year ’ s plan ?
4466,"firstly , the significant reduction in fishing effort means that , in terms of fishing"
4467,"for the waters west of Scotland , it is about 1 000 tonnes"
4468,these are of course only some of the catches .

4536,it is essential that international aid is well coordinated .
4537,the Commission must set up its own appropriate structures on the ground .
4538,it must also cooperate with the international organisations which have been working on the ground for many
4539,"I would therefore like to ask you and the Commission to cooperate accordingly , not only"
4540,that is perhaps even more important than what we bring in here as Parliament 's interests
4541,that is why I am grateful for the 50 % extra speaking time !
4542,we should take the opportunity to make Parliament 's positions clear here and to enter into close
4543,"the next issue , which is also related to quotas , is the extension of the period during"
4544,the Commission considers that the ten years requested in Amendments Nos 11 and
4545,such an extension would hardly have a chance of being accepted by our trading partners .
4546,"as regards the third set of criteria , the capacity to adopt and apply the entire EU"
4547,I am not criticising the fact that public administration is still very often weak and that
4548,it is clear that the transformation in this area takes more time than elsewhere .
4549,it is not enough to create institutions and structures .
4550,"above all , we need the right people ."
4551,"you have to find them , you have to train them and , by the way , you have"
4552,"Mr President , I would like to ask a question :"
4553,Commissioner Nielson and I have often discussed the possibility of Commissioner Nielson visiting Che
4554,could you not perhaps put on the agenda of this EU-Russia Summit the idea that
4555,perhaps you could talk to Commissioner Nielson about this too – as long as Denmark has the
4556,"but regardless of that , it would be important that an official visit takes place here ."
4557,"I would also like to argue , however , that we should not just deregulate ,"
4558,"what we are doing here is actually regulated deregulation , if that were not a bad"
4559,but that 's exactly what it is .
4560,"we are not only opening up the market for gas and electricity , but we are also setting conditions"
4561,I think the two go hand in hand .
4562,"that is perhaps what makes us different , Mr van Velzen , in our assessment of"
4563,"I do not consider this to be complicating the process , but rather part of it ."
4564,"we need a market , we need regulated competition , but energy is also something that citizens are"
4565,"security of supply must be established , and the environmental conditions must be defined ."
4566,this is part of this directive .
4567,"I would like to add one last point , namely the speed with which the European Parliament ,"
4568,"we have now been discussing this issue for almost a year , and I believe that we should"
4569,"secondly , I would like to emphasise that the overwhelming number of national"

4574,he does it in his free time and he doesn ’ t get a penny for it !

4576,we all want to ensure that flying remains safe and that there are still improvements to

4618,I hope that you can give us satisfactory answers to this question .
4619,"Mr President , I do not want to speak out against a debate on Iraq , but your proposal"
4620,we are getting used to increasingly shortening or postponing Question Time on account of matters
4621,I ask you to put an end to this practice .

4626,"I would like to encourage you , Mr President-in-Office , and the Commission to act"
4627,then you will have our support .
4628,we therefore have a great obligation to stand up for Mr Nikitin and his release and
4629,"we as the EU are also obliged by the partnership and cooperation agreement , which is"
4630,"it would be a shame if we were to give in here , because Mr Nikitin -"
4631,we have often discussed this here in Parliament .
4632,he has stood up for the European environment .
4633,he has defended the rule of law throughout the continent .
4634,we should actually be giving Mr Nikitin one of our prizes here in the European Parliament

4676,I believe that the Commission should make it one of its main priorities in 200

4680,we must also consider the time limitation of liability .
4681,"in the case of BSE , it has been shown that a flat limit of liability"

4683,"but it is not only these individual points that are important , but we should also seriously use"
4684,"if we supplement the MacCormick report in this way , the European Parliament will have done"
4685,that is why we have been elected .
4686,the budget provides EUR 83 million for Afghanistan .
4687,"I would ask Parliament to reconsider the reserve , because the Commission will propose a far-re"
4688,"given that the Loya Jirga is currently meeting in Afghanistan , these are important signals"
4689,the European Union therefore urgently needs measures to prosecute these reprehensible crimes

4754,the informal contacts with the Presidency of the Council and the Commission give hope of an agreement
4755,"we , as an elected Parliament , stand up to our responsibilities ."
4756,this is also the view of the vast majority of the economic sectors concerned .
4757,most manufacturers are now internationally active .
4758,a regulation provides a uniform framework of action with the same requirements in all European Member States and

4888,"the previous Commission , which had to resign also because of budgetary problems , was much quicker"
4889,"since the Commission always needs some tutoring , we will gladly give it ."
4890,the best way to do this is to place lines in the reserve that the Commission urgently needs
4891,I hope that this will help to ensure that political priority setting and the budgetary procedure can

4900,I would also like to address the highly controversial issue of feeding food waste .
4901,the example of Austria shows that under hygienically impeccable and officially controlled

4907,"what has happened in Istanbul in recent days shows just how important cooperation with Turkey is , especially"
4908,"regardless of accession , there must be this coordinated and enhanced cooperation ."
4909,but let us also talk about the fact that this will be about strengthening consumer protection in Europe
4910,let us talk about the fact that food security in the Union must be maintained and further strength
4911,"let us talk about the fact that enlargement does not pose a threat to environmental protection ,"
4912,"this is also an advantage for us , not just for Eastern Europeans ."
4913,let us make it clear to the people of the EU that international crime and corruption can be combat
4914,"let us talk about the fact that enlargement is an advantage for all of us , because"
4915,that we have greater chances of meeting the challenges of globalisation together in Europe than if

4921,"I welcome the fact that , in view of the debate after 11 September , this is"
4922,"in the second report , too , it should be noted that it is actually a consequence"
4923,"that is why it is so important that we also see the Union as a social community , which"
4924,this step can therefore only be welcomed and supported .
4925,"firstly , anyone in the Council who wants to reopen the markets only partially"
4926,"I would like to make this very clear , and it is also stated in the committee'"
4927,"these treaties guarantee freedom of establishment , freedom to provide services and freedom of movement of"
4928,these freedoms will only be achieved when all electricity and gas consumers can choose their suppliers
4929,only then will the legal status of the treaties be established .
4930,this is all the more important as the proposal rightly emphasises the fact that radio s

4932,"even in an open and competitive market for electronic communications networks and services , offers aimed"
4933,"it is particularly important , of course , given the time frame we are talking about , that"
4934,that is always the credo that the Commission conveys to small and medium-sized
4935,any preparation that can be done today saves trouble and stress and makes the project even safer
4936,"in addition , a European political party must demonstrate , among other things , that it has been"
4937,"in addition , there are precise rules for the implementation of the regulation and for control ."
4938,European parties are prohibited from using their funds to finance national parties .
4939,this prohibition also applies to the financing of election campaigns .
4940,"the Committee on Constitutional Affairs added a number of points in its deliberations , including a reference"

4947,"the EU , which otherwise likes to talk about the social dimension as part of our European"
4948,where are we with our social responsibility ?
4949,perhaps one more remark that is not uninteresting .
4950,I welcome the fact that China is now joining the group and hopefully other states will join
4951,"therefore , the approach of an opportunity has surely passed ."
4952,it is even less acceptable that financial and food aid from the European Union be used to

4954,this is immoral and may well mean that an important opportunity to take a step towards reconcilia

4956,there should be a registration here as well .
4957,"the third area is , I think , concrete measures that should be proposed , checked"
4958,I assume that we should take into account the victims of landmines in particular .
4959,"most of them are private individuals , civilians , children , and another issue that we have"

4962,how do we actually organise the fight against terrorism and how far do the instruments go ?
4963,"in part , the American argument in connection with the Iraq war has also been an argument about terrorism"

4966,are cases where one could perhaps with a single preventive strike destroy a nuclear power plant so
4967,I believe that we must answer these questions .

4975,we now have before us the Council 's common position on amending the directives laying
4976,Mrs Paulsen has finally made it clear once again what the reason for this is .
4977,"we have a database that provides a great deal of information for patients , doctors and companies"
4978,"we have transparent authorisation procedures , we have reporting of side effects , to name but"
4979,we have a central approval that covers a wide spectrum of indications .
4980,"this means that many , many new innovative medicines are approved centrally and are available"
4981,"we have asked the Commission to put together information , guidelines for information , to ensure that the"
4982,all these are things that directly benefit patients .
4983,"we will have a re-authorisation after five years , whereby a benefit-risk a"
4984,so there are many things that we have moved for patients .
4985,I therefore ask that we perhaps be a little more cautious in our arguments
4986,"now , the United States was in the crossfire of criticism ."
4987,the US has always denied that it is sharing intelligence directly with US companies .
4988,"they have admitted , however , that they listen in detail when it comes to large international tender"
4989,the argument and justification for this is that European companies are bribery and that we have

5006,"this horizontal approach is appropriate , as the rural development programmes are also designed in this"
5007,many comments were made on the implementation of the budget .
5008,I would just like to remind you once again that this year there has been a new monitoring
5009,it is the only parliament that receives such good up-to-date information on implementation
5010,that is not the case in the parliaments of the Member States .
5011,"this is really a new step , and we should stick to it ."
5012,"of course , this is a very important information for you , so that you can also observe how"
5013,I believe that what we have laid down in the resolution is another important step towards good c

5017,have you ever checked this ?
5018,can you prove this to Parliament ?
5019,what has been the Commission 's reaction to the documentation which shows that there is a reason
5020,perhaps one last point : I hope that we can still improve this in order to change the

5032,I would therefore not like to limit my review to 1999 ;
5033,"the rapporteur , Mr Corrie , has made an excellent statement on this ."
5034,much of what moves us today is the result of fundamental transformation processes that have taken
5035,this has also triggered severe shocks in the developing countries .
5036,the aftershocks continue .
5037,ACP cooperation is a dynamic process .
5038,"from Lomé I to Lomé VI , there has been steady progress in the content of"
5039,"at the same time , the number of partner states has increased considerably to 71 ."
5040,"in particular , the enlargement to include Namibia and South Africa has moved all those involved ."
5041,"for these reasons , I strongly welcome the accession of the People 's Republic of"
5042,"for the same reason , I also welcome Taiwan 's accession to the World Trade Organisation ."
5043,we want to integrate and not leave a part of the population outside .
5044,if this oral amendment is accepted - it has been agreed with the applicant -
5045,"we should therefore vote by a large majority for the proposed committee , which provides the basis"
5046,we must be aware that biotechnology is probably the greatest revolution in medicine and technology .
5047,this revolution must not be accompanied by careless legislation .
5048,we must seek the advice of the best experts and ensure that there is coherent legislation
5049,"in particular , the issues of ethics and the protection of human dignity are so important that"
5050,I am mentioning this again because the new Member States will not have sufficient financing options
5051,I have raised this issue now because the Commission was very much involved in transforming this instrument
5052,"Commissioner , take up this problem !"
5053,the problem is not small .
5054,we do not have enough appropriate instruments for the adjustment processes in the course of

5060,let me take this opportunity to say once again what the change in strategy towards Turkey is all about
5061,if a new Commission cannot be able to change positions of the previous Commission which it considers
5062,then we could put robots in there that would always continue what was once said .

5075,we also want special tax arrangements to be examined more intensively and included in this score
5076,"finally , we want the Commission to do its job , which it has been announcing for"
5077,"but for me , this results in three very specific requirements ."
5078,"firstly , the first phase of the roadmap talks about the need to destroy the terrorist"
5079,what contribution do we make to this ?
5080,what contribution can we make to this ?
5081,"further initiatives are needed here , especially in conjunction with the United Nations , in"
5082,"many critics had assumed that , as the opinions on the proposals are reflected"
5083,perhaps the Council had secretly hoped that Parliament would not take a decision for technical and

5085,"whatever the outcome of Thursday 's vote , it will not be binding , because"
5086,"however , this vote will send a signal and oblige you , the Council , as the ultimate"

5088,"thirdly , in the area of employment guidelines in particular , we should also consider whether"
5089,"however , the approaches found there are not necessarily reflected in the employment guidelines"
5090,"I think that this is really important , because aid is also a very important aspect , just"
5091,I would like to express my appreciation to Mr Böge and Mr Colom i
5092,"I can really say , also on this point , that it is a great pleasure to prepare"
5093,on three other aspects :
5094,"first , democracy is based on the participation of citizens and should encourage action ."
5095,"but what if you are not informed , or are insufficiently informed ,"
5096,information is also about ensuring that citizens can see their own interests reflected in our

5098,"yes , you are in favour of abolishing unanimity , but you want it to"
5099,"unity and democracy : yes , but the preservation of power is a little more important ;"
5100,"Charter of Fundamental Rights : yes , but I do not see access to the European Court of"
5101,"upgrading Parliament : yes , but the right of initiative remains exclusive ;"
5102,"election of the Commission President by Parliament : yes , but double accountability to the Council ;"
5103,"a very vague responsibility of the Commission , which opens up a wide margin of man"
5104,"if it is a reality that organised crime generates billions of euros and , by bring"
5105,"if the international drug trade already accounts for 8 % of the volume of trade , then"
5106,if there are already 400 000 asylum seekers coming to Europe
5107,I mean that this report addresses something very concrete and therefore contains provisions which represent a
5108,we will see whether the representatives of Europe at this summit will actually be able to se
5109,we must wish for that !
5110,"first , the continuation of the internal dispute over what has happened in Yugoslavia"
5111,"secondly , reconciliation with neighbours ."
5112,Extradition of war criminals would help in this particular area .
5113,"thirdly , and this is my last point , there is certainly the economic reconstruction that"
5114,"if we can successfully link these three elements , then in five to ten years ' time we"
5115,"here , however , is a list of people and organizations who are merely believed to"
5116,it is still possible – even without a legal process and without the final evidence – to take action
5117,"this measure would be comparable to pre-trial detention , where suspects have not"
5118,"if complicity in the crimes is eventually not proven , the remand prisoners"
5119,such a provision is lacking here .
5120,inclusion of self-employed drivers
5121,the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ’ s proposals to date are still unsatisfactor
5122,"the first pillar , which regulates the organisation of the market and provides incentives for production"
5123,it is therefore essential that these two instruments are always coordinated and harmonised and not used
5124,"in addition , there are also national certifications ."
5125,"there is a notification requirement for these national certifications , which are carried out by the"
5126,"that is , these certifications are notified ."
5127,there are also private certifications .
5128,"in these private certifications , only the principle of truth applies ."
5129,this means that there is no place for lying about what is written on the outside of a
5130,a word on controls .
5131,the Food and Veterinary Office of DG XXIV has launched a series of on-site
5132,"even during the first visit to Belgium , it became clear that the crisis was unfortunately poor"
5133,this was attributed primarily to the lack of coordination between the various administrative authorities
5134,it has also become clear that the Belgian authorities have been completely inadequate in
5135,"thirdly , full harmonisation in the internal market is absolutely necessary ."
5136,"I will make it short and thank you , because here a few people have already endured a"
5137,"I say this also on behalf of my absent colleague Jan Andersson , who"
5138,"this shows that we are dealing with the resources very properly , and my colleague"
5139,"I would like to thank him very much , and of course I would like to thank Mr Vir"
5140,"we are efficient in the use of budgetary resources , which is our great task ."
5141,"we are dealing properly with the resources , which is also our great task ."
5142,that was a subject that we were able to deal with in particular this morning .
5143,"as regards trade agreements , the European Union is currently promoting support from its trading partners"
5144,the Commission considers that additional trade preferences under the Generalised System of Preferences should
5145,"as regards the heterogeneity of systems , there are Member States with considerable deduct"
5146,"in this respect , the complementary systems are of greater importance than in Germany , for example"
5147,let us set the course for the future in Europe quickly : socially appropriate self-
5148,people need time to build up the appropriate provision .
5149,this is the alternative to insurance manipulation and trickery in the legal systems .
5150,the Commission considers that the increase of this contribution to 25 % is justified
5151,I would also like to make it quite clear that I expect the Member States to increase the measure
5152,a decision was also taken on when the Commission should review the current system of financing and report
5153,this basic line of the White Paper strengthens the self-responsible chemicals management of industry
5154,"the European Parliament 's Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy has adopted"
5155,"one of the issues is that the effects of the White Paper proposals on competitiveness , international"
5156,"the Commission is already working closely with the Member States on the controls , without infri"
5157,"in the areas you have mentioned , research programmes have already been funded under the general"
5158,"rules of procedure are not only binding rules of common work , but always also power issues"
5159,it is therefore only too understandable that small groups are scrutinizing every paragraph in detail
5160,the Rules of Procedure must ensure equal treatment of the groups and must not restric
5161,"on the basis of these premises , I would like to reject , on behalf of"
5162,"in this sense , I believe that the proposals made by Mr Poettering and Mr Dell'"
5163,"equal opportunities and gender issues do not only concern us adults , quite the contrary ."
5164,"especially in schools and youth work , the course is set for a self-evident e"
5165,European youth policy must also place great emphasis on this .
5166,may we remind you that the Commission and the European Parliament are natural allies when it comes
5167,"implementation of European legislation requires a specific culture of public administration at all levels ,"
5168,appropriate information and training for officials at these levels is urgently needed .
5169,the existing problems cannot be solved overnight .
5170,"they can only be solved by consensus between all parties involved , states and ethnic groups"
5171,"this is a difficult process and I , like Mrs Pack , am of the opinion , perhaps"
5172,"at present , only the European Union has this confidence ."
5173,neither the United States of America nor Russia nor any of the local states and societies have
5174,"and if Europe does not do this , it would be very problematic !"
5175,"I can also agree with another speaker , Mr Posselt , on this point ."
5176,we are already paying enough in the world and in many regions without having a stabilising influence
5177,it must be different in the Balkans .
5178,"we want to pay , but we also want to have a say in the way this region is"
5179,I also protest that the Euro-Mediterranean partnership is being abused as an instrument
5180,"not only in treaties with Mediterranean countries , but in every agreement with one or more third countries"
5181,each agreement adds a new brick to the wall of the EU fortress .
5182,this report is another example of the European policy of closure towards migrants and refugees .
5183,the countries of the southern Mediterranean are being declared courtyards of Fortress Europe .
5184,they are supposed to ensure that “ undesirable persons ” do not enter the EU
5185,I wonder how the EU intends to insist on respect for human rights and individual freedom with its
5186,"this report once again guarantees the freedom of goods , services and capital ."
5187,he is once again trampling on the freedom and rights of people .
5188,"that is why , despite some positive elements , I am voting against it ."
5189,"I am concerned , however , about Chechnya ."
5190,it seems to me that criticising the conditions in refugee and detention camps has become
5191,I would therefore like to ask the Commission what specific activities it is proposing and undertaking
5192,the positive aspect is that this directive not only provides a framework for the taxation of
5193,"this is a positive thing , because we know that renewable energies in particular are an"
5194,"on the one hand , the actual primary energy costs nothing – at least as a rule – and"
5195,"therefore , the guiding effect of tax incentives for energy use is an important complement to"
5196,"I do not see any contradiction here , but I see here too the addition of instruments to"
5197,"now Erasmus Mundus is going one step further , both internally and externally ."
5198,"internally , this means – something that we would not have thought possible a few years ago –"
5199,an EU quality seal for master ’ s programmes – excellent !
5200,this brings us together and together we move forward .
5201,"in this respect , this new programme is an important step for all of us in improving"
5202,I do not agree with the fact that we have interrupted today after an hour and a half
5203,but I am absolutely not in favour of creating a sequence whereby legislative
5204,I would ask that the order of voting be changed accordingly .
5205,that is why a clear and independent position for the so-called accounting officer is so
5206,"after the Commission has unfortunately ruthlessly abolished the independent financial controller , the"
5207,"he must be able to obtain additional information without being bound by instructions , suspend payments"
5208,today we are talking primarily about the fate of peoples and the fate of people .
5209,we are talking about 70 million people in Europe who have looked forward to this day
5210,they are peoples who are regaining their deserved and natural place among us .
5211,it is about the millions of people who have been undertaking difficult and far-reaching reform
5212,"if I may make a remark here , with a small side view of reform policy or the reform"
5213,"secondly , in the field of staffing , we must be prepared for the great challenge"
5214,one of the objectives of the Lisbon process is to increase the proportion of resident women in
5215,"when we lament the low rate of female employment , including in my country , too many"
5216,for many years we have been calling for a European framework for spouses who help in family
5217,the second point is the mention of dates .
5218,"I am firmly in favour of setting a date , namely when the European Union will"
5219,I believe that giving a total of twelve additional dates would be irresponsible for
5220,can military support help us ?
5221,I think that military support can help us if we have a common foreign and security policy .
5222,"it cannot replace the common foreign and security policy , but it can help and support it ."
5223,now I too am skeptical about an arms race .

5777,the discussion will continue until it finally leads to concrete legislative proposals .
5778,"however , I am convinced that the White Paper puts us on the right track ."

5928,"Madam President , if an export ban on goods prohibited in the Community is now to come"
5929,was this agreed with the trade unions and employers ' associations ?
5930,I do not want to overlook the fact that human trafficking is a lucrative business for

5936,the Commission is aware that the European Parliament also wants to know the names of the beneficiaries

5942,"in her magnificent opening speech to the European Parliament after the first direct elections , Louise Weiss"

5944,this diversity is what matters most .
5945,it is always dangerous for politics to ignore realities .
5946,we therefore welcome the fact that both sides in this conflict are committed to a peaceful

5967,I have sent this catalogue to the committee secretariat because it would simply take far too long
5968,I would therefore like to mention a few of them briefly .
5969,a legal basis must be created for the application of a safeguard clause in the event of
5970,the framework decision is about the Member States applying the same definition of counterfeiting offen
5971,"of course , the first prerequisite is always to have the same definitions in order"
5972,"following the Convention , we have a financial framework which sets a ceiling and thus does"
5973,this framework will in future be laid down by the Council with Parliament 's consent .
5974,that means there is a fixed schedule .
5975,"I would like to briefly mention two points : firstly , the extension of the space available"
5976,"although neither of these areas is included in the Commission proposal , I believe that the European Parliament"
5977,the 1997 report of the Scientific Veterinary Committee on the welfare
5978,I wonder whether we should repeal this regulation as far as it concerns third-country
5979,it is not in force at all !
5980,"it is in the law , but it will not come into force until May 200"
5981,why should we therefore abolish it ?
5982,"I think we should start a legislative process , and we should do so by the end of"
5983,"once global standards have been agreed in the ICAO working groups , we can"
5984,"if , in the course of the legislative process , which will take six months or a year"
5985,that was also the question of my colleague .
5986,we should not start the legislative process with the keyword ‘ repeal ’ but with the
5987,"in this respect , I think Mr Slater must put a little butter on the fish , as"
5988,"he must not only say that he wants to agree with us , he must also say ,"
5989,"on this basis , Madam Vice-President , you will continue to have our full support ."
5990,you will certainly also deal with Afghanistan at Laeken – this is necessary – and
5991,"we must now , however , also lay the foundations for the international community , including the European"
5992,this is our task now in these days and weeks .
5993,"secondly , peace with Syria must finally lead to peace with Lebanon ."
5994,"the Israeli Prime Minister , Mr Barak , ' s objective of withdrawing Israeli troops"
5995,"but Syria , which still has a considerable presence in Lebanon in the Bekaa Valley and"
5996,it is up to Syria to dry up at least part of this terrorist scene in Lebanon .
5997,the latest terrorist attack in northern Israel shows how urgently this is needed .
5998,"the time is right for peace between Israel and Syria , because even President Assad wants to"
5999,"a basic prerequisite is missing , namely a democratic basic order ."

6001,"the requested report on lending activities is now before you , and your proposal to publish a"
6002,"I agree with you , however , that this experience and information about this important part of the history"
6003,"we should not let this go unheeded , and we will see how we can take up"
6004,a final word on this interesting concept of international law .
6005,EU law is also based on international law .
6006,"today , however , we have to note that EU Community law has become a new independent concept ,"
6007,"Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Pirker on his balanced report ,"
6008,"the social integration of economic migrants in the Member States is , as he stresses ,"
6009,the more intensive contact of migrants with the natives may also help to identify so
6010,"there is one drop of wormwood that concerns our group in particular , namely the issue"
6011,"in this respect , I must say from the group 's point of view , we have problems"
6012,I think – and this is one of the lessons that the Bush administration has learned in
6013,I would ask the Commission to think about this and to come to Parliament soon with concrete proposals
6014,another important point of criticism is that the Commission proposal seems to totally ignore the cultural
6015,"agricultural alcohol is produced as a natural product in small and medium-sized farms ,"
6016,Mrs Jeggle has pointed to this .
6017,there have also been some successful restructurings and competitiveness has increased .
6018,"as a result , they are generally in a stronger position today than they were in the past"
6019,I agreed with the rapporteur that the rather strict regulation proposed by the Commission was a
6020,"however , it turned out in the debate in committee , but also with the Council and ultimately"
6021,Mr Jarzembowski has already referred to the special situation in cities .
6022,"we all know , of course , that companies and entrepreneurs are tempted to create monopoli"
6023,"Mr President , I would actually like to see a debate on Latin America not only in connection with"
6024,"merger control is designed to ensure the application of EU competition law , and the Merger Regulation"
6025,we therefore all appeal to the Commission that it would be a mistake if a necessary a
6026,"it is therefore necessary to clarify what happened to the abductees , whether they"
6027,all persecuted and imprisoned persons must be released immediately .
6028,this is the first step towards the rule of law .
6029,"I must say that this is a minimum requirement , given the large aid pledges that the"
6030,we expect action to be taken immediately after the elections !
6031,"otherwise , the objective of permanently reducing existing disparities in development and there"
6032,the amendments tabled by my group also supported this political objective .
6033,secondly - Bertel Haarder will understand this as a Dane :
6034,"when it comes to terrorism , there is a very specific point where we want something very concrete ,"
6035,our ships between Asia and Europe are repeatedly attacked by pirates in certain stra
6036,how can we fail to make it clear to our people that we are able to fight terrorism all
6037,"I believe that the time has come to adapt the railways to the market economy , so that"
6038,now to the content of the report .
6039,"in paragraph 14 , Parliament calls on the Commission to submit a report on the evaluation"
6040,"I would just like to point out that this does not make much sense at the present time ,"
6041,we therefore believe that it is more sensible to carry out this evaluation after the programme
6042,we will of course do so and will send you a report on this .
6043,"after the Nice and Gothenburg Councils , it is clear that enlargement will come ,"
6044,the point of no return is definitely behind us .
6045,the project is now irreversible .
6046,"I do not want to reopen the controversy surrounding the Treaty of Nice , but"
6047,I too have doubts as to whether the Treaty is the best possible solution to both the
6048,but I fear that there will always be different views on what is the best possible solution to this
6049,living in Europe means having to live with compromises .
6050,the Commission is therefore strongly advocating the ratification of the Treaty of Nice here
6051,"Schengen will also cause further rising costs for the Union in the future , as I have said"
6052,"all this means that the budget for the area of internal affairs must be increased , otherwise"
6053,I would also like to say explicitly that the proposals to extend the list of offen
6054,here it is really more a matter of the strategy you choose .
6055,the Commission 's proposed strategy is precisely to adopt the text of the Convention virtually
6056,the concept of an EU tax policy is neither about the collection of Community taxes nor about
6057,it is about tax coordination in order to avoid unfair tax competition and to organise legal
6058,the blocking policy in Nice is therefore very regrettable .
6059,the principle of unanimity still shapes EU tax policy .
6060,this must change if the internal market is to function smoothly .
6061,we are already seeing the problems with VAT and energy tax .
6062,it will soon become clear that the European capital market also needs coordination and alignment process
6063,the Committee on Women 's Rights has raised this issue on several occasions .
6064,"we have had discussions with the Minister for Women - the Deputy Minister , incidentally - and"
6065,there is frictional loss in the work of NGOs and government agencies due to la
6066,we must help in this area as well .
6067,"Mr President , Commissioner , I am very pleased with the report ."
6068,"first of all , I would like to thank you very much for the words of appreci"
6069,"we know that this Parliament is not just engineers , but well-chosen politicians who"
6070,"I would also like to thank Mr Glante in particular , but also Mr Vidal-Qu"
6071,"I would also like to thank you for the compromise , in which the staff has been very"
6072,I believe that the staff here in this area have done a special service by getting familiar with such
6073,since the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously
6074,I am also very pleased that we have succeeded in negotiating a compromise with
6075,this compromise is in line with what we decided in the Committee on the Environment .
6076,we want to reduce the emissions of these machines that do not drive on the road in several
6077,we are indeed moving in the same direction as the United States – only in April this year
6078,"in that respect , I believe that this is exactly the right way forward , because these machines"
6079,I would like to give two examples .
6080,"firstly , one of the main objectives of production aid is to provide olive grow"
6081,"however , as the Court of Auditors rightly notes , ' the objective of production a"
6082,"this means that no one knows if this goal was ever achieved , since an evaluation"
6083,the same applies when it comes to market equilibrium .
6084,"in 1998 , the Commission found that there were 180 million olive"
6085,"this was a surprise at the time , because Olistat calculated with significantly fewer trees"
6086,"this means a difference of 40 million trees , which is about 31 % de"
6087,just imagine you think you are in market equilibrium and then you realize you have a stock
6088,"indeed , the increase in stocks over the past two years suggests a surplus ."
6089,what makes me think is that OPEC is on the side of the US in climate policy .
6090,this means that we are dealing with an ally of the US that could become dangerous
6091,I would be very much in favour of us also discussing climate policy with OPEC .
6092,I do believe that a compromise can be found here .
6093,"thirdly , I agree with the rapporteur that the rules for implementing and transferring responsibilit"
6094,"overall , I am pleased that the proposal has met with your broad support ."
6095,"thus , thanks to your help and your opinion , the Community will soon be able to put"
6096,"we saw just last week , in the European Union mission to the Middle East , how little political"
6097,"this influence is also so small because , in addition to our great efforts in foreign aid -"
6098,"it is not a coincidence , but a straightforward iron law that we will only have"
6099,peace and stability in Europe are the basis for a happy future for all European peoples .
6100,"if they are not implemented everywhere in Europe , they are at risk everywhere ."
6101,the advantages of renewable raw materials in the transport sector have already been mentioned
6102,"it is about reducing emissions , it is about becoming more independent of oil , and"
6103,I regret – and I must say this quite frankly – that no speaker from the Green Group
6104,the ultimate goal is to manage the increase in staff and costs to some extent .
6105,"with these measures , we want to restore the full functioning of legal control , restore confi"
6106,"in view of these facts , we must ask ourselves whether the policy being applied is"
6107,I also look with concern at the candidate countries .
6108,the Commission 's progress reports highlight the urgent need to strengthen administrative capacity and coordination
6109,Mrs Schroedter 's report must be a warning to us .
6110,"with the forthcoming enlargement , a change of course can no longer be postponed"
6111,"Commissioner , it is good to call for and to present coherence of policies ."
6112,but it also wants to be shaped by the political work of the Commission in cooperation
6113,"in 17 recitals and 19 paragraphs of this resolution , which I support"
6114,"our conditions , the coordination of inspections between Member States when it comes to cross-border"
6115,"nevertheless , I believe that the most important requirement of Parliament is the review clause describe"

6118,"Mr President , let me make a final comment :"
6119,you have just referred to the report by Karl von Wogau on the proposals on financial
6120,"I believe - and I am also addressing this to the Council , Mr Ramon de Miguel -"
6121,"if we take this as our task in the future , then we will achieve something ."
6122,"it is not just a question of who can achieve the most , the Commission , the Council or"
6123,"that spirit , Mr President , was clear from your speech ."
6124,we stand by your side in this and encourage you to implement what you have said today with commit
6125,"Madam rapporteur , on behalf of the Commission I would like to thank you very much and"
6126,I appreciate that very much .
6127,"however , my group also believes that further action is needed to safeguard the future of European"
6128,these could be in particular :
6129,"in the area of combating youth and long-term unemployment , the transition from passive to"
6130,"in concrete terms , the percentage of unemployed persons offered training or retraining must be"
6131,we are aiming for a target of 25 % instead of the 20 %
6132,we need vocational education and training in its most modern form .
6133,"here , the existing guidelines must be adapted to the changing requirements of the world"
6134,special attention is paid to female pupils and students .
6135,"we have placed particular emphasis on the inclusion of gemstone dealers , dealer"
6136,what surprised us a little was that the Commission did not include electronic money in the directive
6137,"it seems that the aggressive intelligence of officials within the Commission , who want to"
6138,"in addition , the training level of the operational personnel and the emergency services has been greatly"
6139,"in order to ensure greater safety , the minimum distances between vehicles in the tunnel have also"
6140,"finally , the two original operators , the French ATMB and the Italian SITMB"
6141,any further negotiations must ensure that Afghan women are fully integrated in the efforts to
6142,the current attention of the world public and the media must be used to build new structures and
6143,"my group will use International Women 's Day in 2002 , as it did"
6144,we want to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises in the developing countries
6145,"these businesses employ two thirds of the European Union 's workers , and I believe that it"
6146,a ban on expense compensation is not desirable for the healthcare system .
6147,"I cannot see any form of immorality here , quite the contrary ."
6148,I remember my own university days when we students earned a part of our income from these plasma
6149,a particular concern for my group is also the participation of employees and their representatives .
6150,I accept the rapporteur 's proposal - we agreed on this today - to table an

6152,"however , we have only received estimates so far and now have to gradually replace them with"
6153,this means that we will have to work with a mixture of correct measurements and estimates
6154,there are also formally harmonised definitions for engine power .
6155,"however , we have problems with controlling this because the actual engine power is often higher than the"
6156,"it is certainly important for the maintenance , operation and new construction of infrastructures to agree on"
6157,"but it is almost even more important for equal opportunities in competition that you agree , and as"
6158,only one thing has to be taken into account :
6159,"if we are to achieve fair competition between the different modes of transport , we need what we"
6160,to prevent this discussion means to prevent the integration of the various modes of transport at the

6163,we have a responsibility to free them from the need to chase after their daily food every

6165,women are the drivers of development processes that lead to changes in civil society everywhere in
6166,"will the new members support the deepening of integration , or will integration come to a"
6167,the answer is quite clear .
6168,the new members want a strong community in their own interest .
6169,"they will strengthen , not weaken , the Community idea , and those who believe that a"
6170,"this will not happen , but what we will get is a new enthusiasm , a"
6171,"Parliament , but above all the Member States , demanded massive improvements ."
6172,"this was quickly forgotten when the Commission developed the new instrument for this purpose , the guide"
6173,then the governments in the Member States invoked the principle of subsidiarity and simply
6174,"from the Berlin Summit in 1999 , only the indicative character of the guide"
6175,"however , this at least obliges the Commission to approve only those programmes which can actually"
6176,"of course , the European Parliament must be the decisive factor in democracy and must have codecision"
6177,we do not want less democracy in the European Union than we do at national level .
6178,"the European Court of Auditors has , of course , already called for safety standards , and"
6179,the European Parliament is of the opinion that a Community act is indeed necessary on these issues
6180,"at present , there are no uniform EU safety standards , and if we say today that we"
6181,that is why safety monitoring is particularly important to us before these countries accede .
6182,the Council of Ministers must now take a quick decision on this at the end of the month
6183,we need the green light for the White Paper .
6184,"we must then work together to implement further proposals quickly and in practice , including in terms of"
6185,the removal of agricultural export subsidies and barriers to food exports from developing
6186,"that is why my colleague , Mrs Diamantopoulou , announced last week a check"
6187,"this checklist concerns existing policy instruments , namely legislation , monitoring procedures ,"
6188,governments and businesses must make the best use of these instruments or invent new ones .
6189,"dialogue , transparency , adequate worker participation , anticipation , risk prevention"
6190,"let us do our best to develop these instruments , legislative or otherwise , which will help"
6191,"of course , we must not exclude Chechnya ."
6192,that is a very big question and challenge .
6193,we should remember that these very areas around the Caspian Sea in the Caucasus were geostrategi
6194,they have led to this 20th century of great wars .
6195,I believe that this research should therefore also defuse one of the main reasons for these
6196,this means that the research it contains is also a very important part of renewable energy sources
6197,"finally , on Chechnya :"
6198,"if we now all regret the mass graves and the refugees , then that is nice ,"
6199,what have we done to prevent this ?
6200,why did we not send an intervention force there at the time when all this happened ?
6201,"often , the budgeting process is considered a methodical way of establishing the sad fact"
6202,"that is what I think many of us , many of you , feel when you look at head"
6203,we are in fact suffering from a serious shortfall in the financing of our external policie
6204,"for more than a year , Parliament has been calling on the Council to negotiate with it"
6205,the Council is persistent in its refusal .
6206,I believe that we must prevent more subsidies and ensure that the private provider and the consumer benefit

6208,"we must no longer shy away from this question , otherwise it will be , so to"
6209,"but it is not only this that is hurting the Stability Pact , but also a"
6210,"we are losing a great deal of credit and respect in this region , and this respect"
6211,"I really believe that we must put this in order in the European Union , and this must be"
6212,but the only way out seems to me to be that the people decide and no one else
6213,"however , since the main amendments of the PPE Group have just been approved by"
6214,"the simmering Iraq crisis , with the continued American troop advance in the region and the"
6215,my question to the Greek Presidency in this context is what steps you intend to take in
6216,"financial stability is also needed , and it must be said that the increase in mergers in"
6217,"we must also refer to the OECD reports , which clearly point to the risks"
6218,the emergence of too big to fail financial conglomerates not only promotes moral hazard
6219,"we must do everything we can to ensure that financial stability is not weakened , leading"
6220,part of the commitments they have made are to consolidate their budgets .
6221,Mr Bullmann was right to point out the progress made in this area .
6222,"certainly , more can be done on the issue of debt reduction in some countries ,"
6223,"that is the lesson of the convergence criteria , and this deficit is intended"
6224,"I believe that coordination can really be strengthened , and the policies that can support each"

6226,"in this context , a number of amendments tabled by the ELDR Group are to"

6228,then it will be clear where it still needs repairs so that it can one day make it

6230,Aristotle said : it is likely that something unlikely will happen .
6231,"tomorrow , an accident may happen in an industrial facility that does not fall within the"
6232,I would therefore welcome Parliament 's support for the Commission 's efforts to be proactive
6233,"since 1 July last year , the provisions of the protocol have been in force , so"
6234,"in the meantime , however , thank God , we have managed to initial a new protocol"
6235,the text of the protocol is currently undergoing internal procedures in the Commission and will then

6238,"if we do not think of something better and make Thursday and Friday working days here , we will"
6239,"as rapporteur for the European Parliament , I appeal to the Italian Presidency to give priority"
6240,this Italian Government in particular is likely to be very interested in the further gradual opening up of the

6242,"Furthermore , it is necessary to state very clearly that there is a differentiated"
6243,"even now , with ten countries likely to make the leap , they must also be aware that"
6244,"therefore , there is no security for anyone so far ."
6245,"therefore , things will also have to be examined , which are being discussed with a"
6246,"these are important issues that need to be examined in this context , and for this reason no"
6247,another point is to ensure that the directive does not create protected markets .
6248,industries that use co-incineration plants in their production process have been successfully striving

6282,I would like to comment very briefly on the very passionate debate we have seen here .

6360,we need this directive .
6361,the directive is simply intended to harmonise the existing practice of granting patents
6362,"finally , I would like to recall an anniversary that took place two days ago :"
6363,100 years ago the typewriter was banned in Turkey .
6364,why ?
6365,"because people feared that people could communicate anonymously , that the handwriting"
6366,this was what the ban on the typewriter was intended to prevent .
6367,maybe that would be appropriate again ! ?
6368,"the Council has insisted on committing a clear breach of law , despite the warning"
6369,the reports on the future of European consumer protection policy meet this requirement and at the same time
6370,"in the eyes of many people , regulations on food safety , services , health and safety have"
6371,"many funding programmes , for example research , environmental protection , youth exchanges , to name"
6372,"for this reason , the new approaches to enlargement must be defined for the coming years"
6373,"the Commission has made proposals to increase these programmes , and we should aim to take"
6374,this is particularly important for the accession countries .
6375,"I would , however , like to draw attention to a point which the rapporteur has just mention"
6376,it is Amendment No 10 from the committee responsible .
6377,common foreign and security policy : we support increases in this area .
6378,"I would like to point out once again , however , that cooperation in peacekeeping is"
6379,we demand that this be followed up accordingly .

6384,"in this connection , I would like to thank the European Parliament once again for having worked very hard"

6387,we have an urgent need to catch up here .
6388,"I believe , and I am convinced , that it is not enough to limit ourselves"
6389,we must make a more massive and consistent commitment here .
6390,I hope that this debate will also raise awareness in this direction .
6391,what is now needed is to act quickly – and the Commission fully agrees with you on this
6392,"unfortunately , however , as the Committee on Budgetary Control states in its report , this"
6393,"the Commission is confident that it will be able to present a legislative proposal very soon ,"
6394,we should work together on this .
6395,we will take the report and the opinions of the monitoring committee into account in our work and

6397,"Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I consider the second interim report on"
6398,"for all the positive things , the negative side effects of these access options cannot be overlooked"
6399,"children are confronted every day with a growing wave of brutality and violence in these areas ,"
6400,"it is therefore necessary for all those involved , starting with children , parents , educators"
6401,"as regards innovative sources of development financing , the document remains at a general statement"
6402,"especially for small businesses , it is extremely important that help is provided quickly ."

6416,only by actually checking whether the disposal has taken place can we protect the sea .
6417,the mobile industry is doing badly .
6418,3G technology is only slowly getting up and running – compared to Japan .
6419,we must also do everything at European level to support this sector .
6420,"this includes reliable framework conditions , i.e. the consistent implementation and application of"
6421,all this is also provided for in the Commission 's draft .
6422,"thirdly , it is very difficult for the Commission to assess the efforts made in Greece to"
6423,"the reforestation of the areas concerned is , as you know , an integral part of"

6426,this will help reduce the size of forest areas destroyed by fires in future years .
6427,"I believe that this would also be an important precaution in the interests of safety ,"
6428,we have agreed on the text as it appears .
6429,it is about us calling on Israel to leave the occupied territories in Lebanon .
6430,we had agreed on the text as it stands .
6431,"now the Liberals and perhaps others in this Chamber want to delete this sentence , which calls"
6432,"that is their right , but we cannot say that we have agreed to this ."
6433,we have agreed on what is in the text .
6434,the European Union 's commitment to equality between women and men is enshrined
6435,gender mainstreaming as a political strategy is intended to help achieve this ambitious
6436,"this also follows the definition of the Beijing Platform for Action , whereby gender mainstreaming"

6474,I accept your offer to clarify this by tomorrow in the third part .
6475,"firstly , the conclusion of some pre-1989 measures is still pending"

6492,both of you have never lost your orientation on this subject .
6493,"Mr President , this is a very serious matter ."
6494,I call on the Commission to examine very seriously whether these patents that have been granted
6495,I would like you to take seriously what the European Parliament will decide afterwards .
6496,"I understand that the Commission wants to show rapid success , but when you talk to officials from"
6497,the question remains open for me and for various Member States as to what this global reform will

6563,"both objectives are equally important to the Committee on Industry , External Trade ,"

6569,"we were a little indecisive at first , although we regret it ."
6570,but I have come to the conclusion that it is actually quite a clever timing .
6571,it is actually quite good that we can already give the Commission some ideas on the basis of this

6573,if this report now says that it is a milestone on the way to greater transparency
6574,"it is not nothing , but it is not much more than a pebble ."
6575,what we really need is transparency in practice .
6576,a European transparency initiative – I have already mentioned it on several occasions here –

6597,I do not know whether it makes sense for us to start a discussion at European level about financi
6598,let me be quite clear : we have other tasks to fulfil first .
6599,the first challenge that Europe must face is the question of the delimitation of competences .
6600,the citizen would then of course also want to know :
6601,"what is this Europe responsible for , why does it need finance ?"
6602,"in a second step , we will then of course have to discuss what permanent institutions in this Europe"
6603,"then , at the end of this process , it will have to be decided how the necessary"

6605,"we have achieved a lot , but we will have to do a lot more in the future"
6606,we must insist that nuclear safety at the Union 's eastern external borders is the high

6616,this is a deliberate attempt by a few to profile themselves at the expense of others .

6621,"in this context , I would like to point out the international aspect :"
6622,"of course , we know that shipping is international and that European rules alone do not cover everything"
6623,"however , without European rules , we would not make any real progress in the very cumbersome"
6624,and of course it is true that the double-hull tankers alone do not represent

6629,"no , we agree that the mix of different factors increases ship safety ."
6630,"if we look at our gross national product , that should actually be possible ."
6631,"on the other hand , however , if we look at the Europeans ’ attitude towards the"

6641,this is one of the most important consumer policy approaches in this sector .

6648,I think it is right that there should be a time gap between publication and the debate in

6660,they still have a large deficit compared to the EU average .
6661,I understand that increasing the mesh size will result in short-term losses in catch weight

6665,the EU Road Safety Programme should clearly define the main priorities .
6666,"above all , a systematic approach in this problem area is important ."
6667,cooperation between the Commission and the Member States must be called for .
6668,firstly – and thank God this is not happening on the backs of air passengers
6669,we already had the discussion on the Single European Sky at the beginning of this evening .
6670,"we will therefore have disputes between the airlines , the air traffic control and also the airport"
6671,I hope that we will find viable solutions here .
6672,"thank God , this is not the problem of the air passenger , but I can see a"

6679,I think that reasonable scientific preparation and preparation in advance would have helped to make

6683,"however , if we have learned and must learn anything from Nice , it is that Europe is"

6687,"as you know , the issue of children in Romania is one of the issues that the Commission is"
6688,"there is not a single issue in the area of accession negotiations , except perhaps"
6689,"we must also be clear , and I stated this at the beginning of my report , that"

6703,"Mr President , first of all , I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur ."
6704,it is quite amazing how you have been juggling this difficult matter in the many meetings we
6705,"I sometimes get very dizzy , and I have to see that I comply ."
6706,but I would like to put a different focus :
6707,"I remember that during the last parliamentary term we discussed – Commissioner Schreyer , if"
6708,it was about enlargement .
6709,"at that time , the service for Kosovo and Serbia was not even in the pipeline ."
6710,there was a discussion about whether we should call for an increase in this framework .
6711,"today , with the budget and also with the draft budget for 2001,"
6712,it is also not sensible for Parliament to restrict itself in the budget and always comply with

6714,this has saved us all a lot of time and money and yet has led to an

6716,"as regards the question of the World Bank project , I can tell you that the Commission is"
6717,I therefore do not believe that we have much influence at this very last minute .
6718,"if there is any influence left , it is through the Member States ."
6719,"when it comes to the cooperation of repressive authorities , as in this case , the"
6720,the proposed amendment to the Schengen Agreement does not provide for anything else in principle

6724,we welcome the formation of the all-party government and hope that it will be able to take
6725,we hope that neither party has separatist or nationalist views .
6726,so I think we are on the right track .
6727,I accept the Council 's proposal .
6728,we will try to send a delegation to Skopje before the summer .
6729,I do not want to question or attack mobility – we need mobility – but we must

6737,we doubt that .
6738,"we believe that this title does not give Parliament any rights , but rather that the fact that these"
6739,"I think that this is crucial , not only the overlap , but also the question of who"
6740,"it is about the delicate balance of power between Parliament , the Commission and the Council ."
6741,"the Council is taking on more and more tasks , trying to solve more and more inter"
6742,"this would mean placing them within the Commission , which would also strengthen Parliament 's control"
6743,"that is the one big fear , namely that we have no real control ."

6745,we want to clearly and unambiguously strengthen Europe 's international role and increase its

6747,we do not want to bureaucratize or centralise Europe .
6748,that is not our idea of Europe !

6750,"however , the impression is that anti-European forces within the army and the administration are behind the"
6751,this shows in retrospect that the concession made to Turkey in Helsinki was perhaps premature
6752,tomorrow we are to adopt Article 3 ( 2 ) either in the Commission 's version
6753,both versions set out the conditions for suspending cooperation in the event of substantial human rights
6754,I see these violations and therefore think it is wrong to adopt these documents at this time
6755,we would be taking our own paper and our credibility to the absurd .
6756,my group is in favour of postponing both reports in these circumstances .
6757,"two weeks ago , in a similar situation , we sent the right signal to the Russian government ."
6758,we should do the same in this matter .

6775,"this is of the utmost importance , in combination with your amendments or my own ."
6776,the criticisms made in the report must of course be taken seriously .
6777,it is not acceptable for the EIB to present its activities on its own website in only

6781,it is impossible to estimate what may still be paid out under PHARE .
6782,the rapporteur has already mentioned the 650 million .
6783,"in this respect , we should all feel uncomfortable here ."
6784,"Commissioner , I believe that in order to finally get to an orderly and reasonable procedure ,"
6785,we cannot therefore be satisfied with the fact that all Member States are parties to the

7342,"many people have asked me , what does the Commissioner have against giraffes ?"
7343,why does he forbid zoos to vaccinate ?

7370,I would like to assure you that the Commission has always maintained close contacts with minorities and
7371,"the European Parliament has no competence in this matter , as does , for example , the Commission"
7372,"it is not the Commission , the European Parliament , the Greens or Greenpeace that decides"
7373,"they decide on it , the courts decide on it and no one else !"
7374,and that is a good thing !
7375,we need to implement the directives more quickly .
7376,"we need to speed up the decision-making process , not 28 months as in the"
7377,we need the debate to be held on the review of the rules on jurisdiction in the light

7650,this leads to a certain discrepancy between the Commission 's view and what you are
7651,"I would like to comment on what you mentioned in this context , namely , on the"
7652,"this is , of course , again a question of the human resources available ."
7653,"we are now starting with ongoing legislative projects , and this is of course only the first"
7654,"we will see , once a procedure has been established , to what extent this can also be"
7655,we should now use the time given to us by the Heads of State or Government to think
7656,that is the only serious approach when we are discussing the financial period after 200
7657,the critical question throughout the whole process has always been the question of whether to support Mrs Niebler
7658,"I will also be speaking in favour of our support for it , and that is because"
7659,the Commission has rightly pointed out that we need more harmonisation in this area and
7660,"no question , we have been discussing this point for years ."
7661,"I have always been a fervent supporter of a single European regulator in the past , but the"

7687,"whether the authorisation of genetically modified vines will be accepted in future , or whether"
7688,this will certainly be discussed at length elsewhere .
7689,that is why we are now trying to take a tiny step towards this goal .
7690,the Commission is willing to play an active part in this task .
7691,I would like to expressly and very warmly thank her for this .
7692,it is prepared to present a working document on the state of the collection of own resources at

7694,this will provide us with a good basis for discussion in order to be able to hold a debate

7768,"I trust , Commissioner Lamy , that you will be able to achieve this , together with your"
7769,it will not be an easy task .
7770,but you have excellent prerequisites for this .
7771,I am grateful to you for always supporting Parliament in playing a greater role in

7773,"like you , I hope that we will achieve more in this area in the future ."
7774,I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the Members of this House who have
7775,we must also be clear about one thing :
7776,"the Council has accepted a whole series of important things here , but our cars are far from clean"
7777,"we are facing an explosion in traffic , which we would not have believed , both"
7778,"traffic has not even started there yet , and it will certainly increase – and I can only"
7779,"perhaps , Mr Lange , you could try again to reach some kind of compromise with the"
7780,the environment in Europe has certainly become more difficult for competition policy once again .
7781,it would therefore be important - and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is calling for
7782,"let us therefore plan , promote and stand for freedom together in the future !"
7783,in Germany we have experience with this .
7784,"in addition to state research funding , we have a research foundation that has been functioning well"
7785,"if you could do this at European level , it would not be a bad idea ."
7786,"the suggestion that Germany , for example , needs more protection against hostile takeovers because there"
7787,you cannot become protectionist because other countries are doing so .
7788,"European nation states will now , following this vote , protect their industrial and financial pieces of me"
7789,"in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , we welcomed the fact"
7790,"at the request of the European shipbuilding industry , this procedure has now been initiated ,"
7791,that is a good thing !
7792,"however , despite the protocol of 22 June 2000 , the South"
7793,this is in view of the fact that the 1996 Trade and Cooperation Agreement
7794,"the Commission 's target of January 2001 can , in my opinion , only"

7796,"the crucial question that the Convention is dealing with is whether the Council , where it acts"
7797,the Commission says that this proposal needs to be examined .
7798,that 's all there is to it !
7799,I would have expected the Commission to take a clear position on this .
7800,"however , the fact that she leaves the issue of the legislative Council so unclear and"
7801,that is why I consider this proposal to be highly questionable on a crucial issue .
7802,I would also like to raise the issue of administrative budgets .
7803,"I ask you quite clearly , for whom is the administration there ?"
7804,"not for itself , however , but rather so that what must be ensured through the various institutions"
7805,"that is why we in the European Parliament should now , at the middle of the legislative term"
7806,I have relatively little sympathy for the fact that we are now setting up one subcom
7807,these are things that we will definitely have to talk about this year as well .
7808,"this , of course , also has implications for the budget ."
7809,another important point on which the committee agreed is the problem of network connection and network access for
7810,the Commission 's proposal to grant priority access to the renewable grid is not under
7811,I think there is agreement on this .
7812,"however , the report has made the Commission 's general text on the issue of burden sharing"
7813,"this is necessary , as only clarification will create legal certainty and avoid disputes ."
7814,last Friday we said goodbye to Pierre Pflimlin in the cathedral here in Stra

7833,"from the Commission 's point of view , the package on the table is balanced in terms"
7834,the concept stands .
7835,negotiations are progressing rapidly .
7836,the next stage is clearly outlined .
7837,"by the time the European Council in Seville meets , it will be necessary to draw"
7838,"it is true that geographical features require special development , but unlike many in this House"
7839,I am critical of the attempts by many Members to maintain the existing status quo and
7840,"I protest against attempts to introduce new criteria here that do not concern poverty and unemployment ,"
7841,"I therefore believe that it is right for the Commission to stick to the objectives ,"
7842,"this is the only way to tackle various difficulties with a sound approach , such as the"
7843,"these things should also be taken into account , and there are a number of instruments for this ,"
7844,"I hope , Commissioner , that you will finally present us with a clear concept of sustainable development"

7846,"it is , of course , difficult to sit here quietly and give a speech that was"

7860,"Mr Grosch has already said that we can make as many wonderful , detailed or even more"
7861,that is one of the most important points for me .
7862,"at present , we have an average density of regulation of just under 1 % , and"
7863,"however , this varies greatly between the Member States of this Community , and that is why"
7864,"this will make it possible to check a period of 28 days on the roadside ,"
7865,I agree with those who have said that there are few conflicts in the world that are as

7867,I just wanted to ask specifically – because this question has not been answered – is humanitar

7869,"the rapporteur had proposed that raw materials , components not authorised for human consumption ,"
7870,the rapporteur has also addressed the other side .
7871,there are areas where raw materials are extracted that exceed these maximum values .
7872,what about those who produce them ?
7873,the rapporteur said that they could do nothing about it .
7874,"on the contrary , those who receive these foodstuffs can do nothing for it !"
7875,that was the conflict .
7876,I understand that the rapporteur has returned this opinion .
7877,but this Mr Bangemann was also sent here twice by the Kohl government .
7878,I would like to clearly dispel the myth that the opposition in the Federal Republic of Germany

7880,"I would like to ask Mr Poettering , who is obviously not here at the moment :"
7881,where was his party to control his own Commissioner ?
7882,he was hardly sustainable as Minister of Economic Affairs .
7883,he has flew out of the Liberal Group in the European Parliament .
7884,"he was also very , very often controversial as a Commissioner ."
7885,let us remember the yacht affair .

7903,this directive is a success for the European Parliament .
7904,we amended the Commission proposal at our first reading .
7905,we will amend the common position in our favour at second reading .
7906,this directive is not a final product .
7907,it is a first step .
7908,"I believe that this directive will bring benefits to citizens because more providers will compete , that"
7909,"it is an advantage for the internal market because of the financing of risk capital , and"

7933,"these include , for example , the concentration of cross-compliance on the most important"
7934,but there are other issues where the discussion will still require great efforts so that we can reach solutions
7935,"the Presidency will certainly make this effort together with the Commission , particularly next week in"
7936,"much more crucial , however , is that the adaptation of the test regulations for cornering"
7937,"instead , it refers to Directive 97 / 27 / EC , which"
7938,"this means that the adaptation to scientific and technical progress is not being taken into account , and"
7939,this will not allow the approval of the rigid 15-meter buses !
7940,the freedoms and rights of citizens include the integrity of body and soul .
7941,"this is true not only for our children , but for all children ."
7942,it is our task to implement this with all the means at our disposal .
7943,this was the consensus reached by all parties involved .
7944,I feel exactly the same when I hear that the Member States have had a constructive exchange

7946,"it is high time that there was Community competence for health policy , and that it was in"
7947,"if we do not recognize this now , I do not know when we will !"
7948,we should have recognised this in the BSE era !

7950,"the minutes say , let us not talk aloud about the dangers of BSE , God"
7951,what consequences did it have in the end ?
7952,what I would have liked from the Council would have been to see it do something concrete .
7953,I would have liked the Commission to have done the same .
7954,"I personally welcome the legalisation of all phases of the sanctioning procedure , and"
7955,"as an Austrian , I know what I am talking about ."
7956,the rule of law has prevailed over political arbitrariness here .
7957,many have complained about the lack of progress on qualified majority voting .
7958,I see it much more calmly .
7959,"if the Heads of State or Government were reluctant in certain areas , it was not"
7960,"rather , they are the result of serious problems and concerns , and each of them is"
7961,I think we still have one hope .

7964,"we can only appeal to the governments to accept the Convention 's draft , which is"
7965,Russia plays a key role in Georgia and in the whole of the South Caucasus .
7966,we in the European Parliament must raise this issue when we discuss relations with Russia .
7967,but now we must help Georgia to overcome its crisis .
7968,I therefore believe that there is something missing from this programme .
7969,a genuine European citizenship depends on the creation and visibility of a genuine
7970,declarations of principle are insufficient !
7971,we need content that is continuously implemented by the Commission in the way I have described
7972,we must also not lose sight of the fact that we have exploited our own
7973,just think of the reform of the CFP .
7974,it would be quite fatal - as one of the previous speakers has already said - if
7975,"as far as the specific questions are concerned , I believe that this building is certainly very"
7976,I would like to follow up on what some of my fellow Members have said .
7977,"in order to make efficient use of this building , we must ensure that we hold our"
7978,"if we do not make proper use of this building , if we end the plenary session on"
7979,this jam in the workflow leads to countless additional plenary sessions .
7980,then we have a session porridge across all weeks .
7981,I suggest …
7982,"Madam President , after our President has already wished us a merry Christmas this afternoon ,"
7983,"I would like to say that we wish you a blessed Christmas and , with you , of"
7984,a final point that plays a particular role in the whole debate is the consolidation of democracy .
7985,India is a democratic country and we hope the same for Pakistan when free elections are held in
7986,I hope that we will do everything possible within the framework of our CARDS aid programme
7987,that would be the best we could do for peaceful coexistence in Bosnia and Herzegovina
7988,that is why we are also demanding that the People 's Republic of China respect the fact
7989,and that must be respected .
7990,I call on China to respect that and to ensure that Hong Kong can exercise its own rights and
7991,"it is also the responsibility of Commissioner Patten and the High Representative of the Council ,"
7992,"as rapporteur , I had only one wish to add to this ."
7993,cooperation must not be limited to organised crime .
7994,it must cover the whole spectrum of serious and cross-border crime in the interests of
7995,that is why I have proposed extending the legal basis to Article 29 of the
7996,"the committee responsible has followed me in this , and the signals from the Council are also"
7997,"yes , we need more transparency ."
7998,we therefore call for the Council meetings to be open to the public .
7999,"yes , we need to remove barriers , blockades and obstacles ."
8000,we therefore criticise the fact that election dates such as those in France and Germany and
8001,"now we have the situation that we have a hidden , semi-open declaration ."
8002,"Interestingly , the then Federal Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany also worked on it ."
8003,"he then had a record given to him , in which it was written that he actually wanted the"
8004,"when the BSE turmoil broke out in Germany , this Minister wrote to me that"
8005,so exactly the minister who had just agreed to the half-open declaration !
8006,a real lesson in political culture !
8007,the third is the question of openness and transparency .
8008,"yes , this too is a test of the Commission 's relationship with this Parliament , that we"
8009,this is crucial for us !
8010,it is also quite clear – and we have always said this clearly – that if it turn
8011,we are therefore in favour of the principle of individual trust and responsibility being added –
8012,but we do not want multi-party politics to play a role here .
8013,we do not want Commissioners from small political groups from smaller countries to be blackmailed
8014,"therefore , this should be enjoyed with caution ."
8015,we need sensible regulations that do not undermine or disturb the principle of collegiality .
8016,the Charter of Fundamental Rights is indeed an important political project for the future of the European
8017,it makes the rights of citizens transparent in relation to the institutions and bodies of the European Union
8018,the text now before us is undoubtedly a delicate political compromise between the different
8019,"as far as climate protection and the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol are concerned ,"
8020,"globally , it is necessary to protect our forests to save us from disasters ."
8021,I am therefore very grateful to the previous speaker for her comment .
8022,I would also like to draw attention in particular to the protected and banned forests in the
8023,"thirdly , energy : we want to ensure that the programmes for intelligent energy , but also"
8024,there is an urgent need to take more intensive measures to secure and guarantee our energy
8025,Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament .
8026,"it is therefore unreasonable to subject , for example , assistants working here to"
8027,"Brussels is an important place of work , but it is just one place of work , just"
8028,"I therefore believe that the system must be made flexible , that there must be freedom of choice"
8029,"I therefore believe that the Council , the Commission and Parliament must find a regulation that will give"
8030,"as a matter of principle , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development regrets that there is no"
8031,this is all the more regrettable as we have a claim to multifunctionality in agricultura
8032,"it would be appropriate to have a separate research package for this , especially as agriculture"
8033,"the Commission will also improve the information content of its accounts , beyond existing legal obligations"
8034,"during the debate on the Court of Auditors ' report , I already promised that I"
8035,"the Commission has already decided , on my proposal , that the auditors are to be instructed"
8036,what are our main amendments ?
8037,"in order to achieve effective use of the rail networks , we agree with the Council that"
8038,"however , we believe that five years is enough to show the railways and their employees that"
8039,we believe that access for railway companies should be extended to the entire network of the fifteen
8040,"thirdly , the increase increases the ECB 's ability to react and"
8041,"in the event of a major imbalance in the markets , the European Central Bank will be"
8042,it will be able to respond more flexibly because it has the means to do so .
8043,"in our report , we have also introduced an additional model for increasing the transparency of this"
8044,"I know that your work will not be made particularly easy , because the coordination of economic"
8045,"nevertheless , I wonder to what extent a further contribution can be made ."
8046,"the more decisive definition of price stability , which now aims at inflation below , but"
8047,but I still believe that our central bank has a more rigorous definition of price stability than
8048,"therefore , you have to consider again and again whether a certain change of direction would not be"
8049,I also think it is important that we keep on discussing inflation and deflation and their
8050,"even in times of strong economic growth , a symmetrical target of 2 % with a"
8051,"on the one hand , we have a supplementary and amending budget ."
8052,"in one of them , the European Union , the Commission , shows that it intends to follow"
8053,we have made a very clear statement over the course of the year .
8054,"however , there are two points that are very important to me for the future of the competition ."
8055,one is the issue of subsidiarity .
8056,"we all agree that competition is necessary for the economy and that it promotes efficiency , and"
8057,"competition between regions will certainly strengthen the European Union , not weaken it ."
8058,"I would like to mention the topic of GA funding , the example of savings banks"
8059,"here , a region has created something out of its own strength to market its own products ."
8060,this self-initiative must not be destroyed at European level .
8061,"as regards the geographical scope , I think that the principle of wider Europe must"
8062,"I support the participation of youth organisations from the European Union , the Member States , including"
8063,"however , I think that the activities of organisations that work with partners outside the countries mentioned"
8064,the European Parliament has a long and unbroken tradition of defending fundamental and human rights .
8065,that is why the decisions of the Cologne and Tampere summits can also be
8066,these demands from Parliament are in line with this tradition and they are the result of the nature
8067,legal enforceability and access to the courts is inextricably linked to fundamental
8068,"on 16 December last year , in connection with the decision on the 200"
8069,"Commissioner , I really just wanted to leave you a little message , both for this report and for"
8070,"at some point , we will have to make a decision , because the conciliation procedure is"
8071,"Parliament is of course always pleased when the Commission , as a partner of Parliament , fights"
8072,I think that is not necessary in this case .
8073,"I would , however , like to appeal to the Commission to monitor closely whether China is also"
8074,"in recent years , China ’ s behaviour has not been very encouraging , after"
8075,"promises were made , but they were attempted to undermine ."
8076,"in this respect , I hope – and it would be interesting to hear the Commissioner comment on how"
8077,"food safety is the fundamental requirement for the consumer , because consumers want to eat healthy ,"
8078,"the central tasks of the Authority are therefore risk assessment and risk communication , a rapid"
8079,the second point concerns the vote on the confirmation of the President of the Commission and of
8080,we have very different procedures in the Member States in this respect .
8081,"in the situation in which the European Parliament is , I believe that a secret vote and not a"
8082,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
8083,the 2002 budget is coherent and round from Brussels ' point of view
8084,"the Berlin decisions still offer room for manoeuvre , especially since the Member States ' ab"
8085,"I expect that , in the implementation of the 2002 budget , the structura"
8086,"here too , we should have learned from our experience in Bosnia and Herzegovina ."
8087,"today , three years after Dayton , we still do not know where many of the missing are"
8088,"I receive weekly requests from families who are still looking for missing persons today , and"
8089,"therefore , activities are planned at international , national and local level in the coming year to"
8090,the main objectives of this year are to raise awareness and knowledge about mountain eco
8091,"after all , mountain areas account for 30 % of the total area and 20"
8092,"however , as I pointed out in my opinion on the report at first and second reading ,"
8093,"the proposal to impose the same rules on tar , nicotine and carbon monoxide on"
8094,it is certainly a good intention to feel responsible for the health of smokers in third
8095,"if this sense of mission , however , leads the tobacco industry to relocate its"
8096,"in the small Grand Duchy of Luxembourg alone , such a measure would result in the re"
8097,that can 't be .
8098,the Council has laid a very strange but dangerous egg in our nest with the
8099,"in practice , this article states that in the pre-contractual phase – which includes ,"
8100,"Furthermore , a service provider would have to set up not just one website but 1"
8101,"with such obstacles , it is hard to talk about a common internal market !"
8102,"in making this statement , I wanted to warn against excesses with unpredictable consequences"
8103,on the contrary !
8104,the third point has also been mentioned .
8105,"like Mr Rack , I come from a transit country where this issue plays a particular role ."
8106,we do not want to unilaterally worsen the conditions of competition for some countries and improve
8107,but I believe that we should do everything we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods
8108,"the second would be a question to Mr Nielson , if I may ."
8109,"Mr Nielson , you have just mentioned the Financial Regulation as the basis for your efforts in"
8110,now I would have liked to have a little explanation .
8111,I myself have been dealing with the Financial Regulation for months now in the committee I represent .
8112,"we know that it is currently pending in the Council , but Parliament has of course also put"
8113,we see that this is dragging on .
8114,but maybe you can make it a little more clear what this means for you and your area .
8115,I think it would be helpful for us too .
8116,"the first question , the SAPARD programme , was raised by many speakers in the debate"
8117,"firstly , I would like to point out that there are seven programmes running in the mean"
8118,"I am pleased to announce that another country , Poland , will join this month , and Poland"
8119,this is also to give you a hint that it is a little too easy to focus only
8120,"I believe that this approach must take into account the diversity of the candidates and , of"
8121,"the reality , as described in the annual report , is rather sobering ."
8122,especially regrettable and hard to understand – there is still a lack of reliability in
8123,"in other words , the Commission has not put its books in order , and the accounts reflect"
8124,"there is no information on advance and down payments at the end of the year , and the"
8125,"at the same time , potential claims are significantly overvalued , even overvalued"
8126,Parliament has already made explicit reference to these serious accounting errors in the discharge procedure
8127,"although it is difficult and takes time to make fundamental changes in budgetary management , one could have"
8128,"but even that seems to have failed , and I am very sorry about that ."
8129,"Mrs Schreyer , when you took office , you promised us that you would make an"
8130,"reversing the trend , namely moving away from military action and towards conflict prevention and"
8131,we have consistently condemned the war in Chechnya and we have also postpon
8132,we also expect the same from the Council .
8133,"yesterday 's Council statement is a positive sign , but it comes too late ."
8134,it is to be hoped that the Council will not take as long to follow our proposal to
8135,"the Council and Parliament created the legal basis for OLAF in 1999 , and"
8136,this legal basis created OLAF as an office which is part of the Commission in the administrative sense
8137,"this also means that if , for example , there were problems or irregularities in the conduct of"
8138,"to take account of this , the Commission has said that it wants to have a transparent procedure"
8139,this means that an advisory committee first reviews the applications and makes recommendations to the person
8140,"in the case of OLAF , it is ultimately the director who decides on the re"
8141,the advisory committee is now composed in such a way that the people who are not
8142,"the Court of Auditors , the European Court of Justice and the Supervisory Committee are represent"
8143,I would remind you that this solution is intended to ensure transparency in the appointment of
8144,"Mr rapporteur , I heard your arguments almost literally in this House almost 20"
8145,"at that time , too , your country was at the forefront of the braking forces ."
8146,it is quite amazing that even in two decades nothing has been learned about this .
8147,I believe that water is also the life of the future .
8148,we must do everything we can to prevent our waters from being polluted even more .
8149,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
8150,"I would first like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Morillon , very warmly for his"
8151,I am pleased that we can see a broad agreement .
8152,"I am also pleased that Parliament has reacted very quickly to the common position , which"
8153,"Furthermore , we do not yet know in this European Union what the economic benefits of these"
8154,"economic institutes , national ministries and the Commission have all owed us an answer to this"
8155,but we need this answer to know which direction we are going in .
8156,"I believe that the formula still applies : employment creates growth , but growth also create"
8157,we must focus on real growth and not just on growth potential .

8159,"the Council could reach a final agreement on the proposal today in Luxembourg , taking into account the a"
8160,"for the Commission , however , the outcome in the Council will remain somewhat unsatisfactor"
8161,the text before the Council contains provisions which have watered down the regulation we wanted in some

8170,"since joining the negotiations on this convention in 1997 , the Community"

8172,the way to this convention has been an example of positive and active multilateral cooperation in international

8175,"thirdly , the issue of children 's rights is closely linked to gender issues in"
8176,"the educational goals for children , and especially for girls , cannot be fully achieved if"
8177,the Commission is therefore strongly committed to paying particular attention to the educational needs
8178,it is currently preparing an action plan on gender equality to address this concern .
8179,it also takes gender-specific issues into account in all its own educational programmes .
8180,I have been the President of the Tibet Intergroup of the European Parliament since 199
8181,"all our speakers and all our guests , who know China very well , leave no doub"
8182,the Commission will therefore make recommendations on the basis of next year 's progress reports
8183,it will make every effort to ensure that negotiations with these countries can be concluded successful

8188,"Mr President , as a former member of the Convention , I must say that I am really surprise"
8189,"you only have to look at the note by the Presidency , document 37 ."
8190,what you get to read there is – I think – unbelievable .
8191,the mere list of the amendments to the Convention text is almost 20 pages long
8192,"when I see this , I cannot help but get the impression that some governments have obviously"
8193,"unfortunately , the public is largely only informed about the points of disagreement"
8194,"these are certainly not unimportant issues – in my view , there must be no return to"
8195,"without the innovations mentioned , I might have voted for a postponement in"
8196,"this is particularly true of the accounting and accounting system , where personnel decisions were"
8197,this report contains so many contradictions to our views that I must say that the European People
8198,"firstly , the core of the Single Sky is the functional airspace blocks ;"
8199,how are they realized ?
8200,what added value does a regulation have if it is left to the discretion of the Member States
8201,Member States can already create airspace blocks bilaterally .
8202,"we believe that we need a legislative proposal from Eurocontrol and the Commission , otherwise nothing"
8203,"above all , however , the report fails to make it clear that a social Europe must"

8226,"we welcome the fact that , as of 1 May , we will also have new Commissioners"

8254,I have supported Turkey 's candidacy from the outset and am pleased with

8256,is the Presidency prepared to take an initiative to resolve the Kurdish problem - and here
8257,these directives actually bring a long process to an end .
8258,"as someone who has been in this Parliament for a long time , I would like to point out"
8259,we said to ourselves at the time that we did not want to leave it to the

8261,"if you have money at your disposal of this magnitude , you must try to attract large"
8262,I would like to encourage the Commission to perhaps also use these small funds to encourage private companies
8263,"I would also like to mention a second point here : we believe , Mr President , that ,"
8264,"I can see that the smaller Member States are afraid – perhaps rightly , per"
8265,whatever compromise comes out :
8266,the European Parliament must keep one point in mind :
8267,the 732 Members we will be in the next parliamentary term is quite a
8268,we will probably increase to 800 Members in this House between 200
8269,"if there are attempts to increase the number of Members even further , then I would like"
8270,"here , too , I would ask the Council and the Italian Presidency – I know that they"
8271,"I am too late , I have spoken too long , Mr President , thank you for everything"
8272,"thirdly , promotions were granted on the basis of criteria that were not judicially"
8273,the Bureau has taken steps to prevent this from happening in the future .
8274,"here too , we will see how this new procedure will be put into practice ."
8275,the second group I would like to mention is the Kurds .
8276,"Turkey – a candidate country , even though we are not yet negotiating with Turkey – does"
8277,I consider this to be a wrong approach and also contradicts the statements of the Council
8278,but even if we do not recognise the Kurds as a minority and do not
8279,I therefore believe that it is very important that we help the Kurds to get their rights
8280,"this , too , is stated very clearly in the Belder report ."
8281,in the area of export refunds and in the context of a new EU agricultural policy
8282,this would not only make it easier for us to defend our position aggressively
8283,"in other words , despite all the problems of the crisis in which we are currently in with"
8284,"in all these areas , we obviously need the expertise of the agencies ."
8285,we therefore also expect the necessary financial resources .
8286,"however , with all the commitment to the principle of competition , competition is not an end in"
8287,competition is an instrument and does not always lead to optimal solutions .

8406,"it is sad that a country like Great Britain , with its centuries-old empire"

8408,this is certainly a success for democracy in Europe .
8409,"Mr President , I would like to support Mr Jarzembowski for another reason ."
8410,the plenary has substantially amended a Commission proposal by a large majority .
8411,the Commission must also accept that Parliament substantially changes a Commission proposal .
8412,that is why I am in favour of the process continuing .
8413,"Mr President , I think it is also important that the rapporteur should say something briefly on"
8414,I regret that we have not been able to act responsibly in this Parliament .
8415,"but now Mr Watson is right , and we should support Mr Watson ."
8416,"I ask every Member to support this , otherwise we will make ourselves a laughing"

8425,"firstly , I think it is extremely positive that this report exists ."
8426,I also thank the rapporteur for her efforts .
8427,"that is why we should now move a little further , and at a little speed , as I"
8428,I therefore ask my fellow Members and the Commission to speed up the pace a little
8429,the inclusion of the local dimension in the European employment strategy will greatly improve it .
8430,"it is about European coordination of national employment policies , including local employment policies"
8431,it is about subsidiary solutions that reconcile flexibility and social security .

8433,"this system will be a certain technological competition to the existing American GPS , which is good"

8459,any other procedure would mean a massive democratic deficit .
8460,the competences must be clearly delimited .
8461,"Article 87 must include the area of public service for social , cultural and charitable interest"

8469,Mr Bakopoulos ' report makes a valuable contribution to further progress in safety .
8470,the fact that the committee voted unanimously speaks for its convincing work .
8471,I assume that the plenary will vote with a similar conviction .
8472,"I am not speaking on my own behalf , but on behalf of a large majority"
8473,"I also expressly support the second part of the Commission document , because what is the use of"

8486,"if you want to give yourself an address as a publicist entrepreneur , it says “ dot"

8488,that is worth something if we can bring it together and if the Commission finds the appropri

8491,I fear that the crisis in the totally impoverished country will soon escalate and become
8492,I therefore believe that it is necessary for the Council and the Commission to act now and
8493,"in my opinion , the following must happen :"
8494,"a troika of the EU , OSCE and Council of Europe must be formed and a"
8495,this mission must agree with the government on the steps to be taken to resolve the crisis .
8496,we must also talk about sanctions so that the government does not take these steps half-heart
8497,"the Commission is in close contact with the Czech , German and Austrian authorities to obtain"
8498,"unfortunately , the funding rules under which we have to work do not allow direct assistance"
8499,but the Commission is making considerable funds available under the PHARE programme for the fight against organis

8505,agriculture cannot be directly compared to other sectors of the economy .
8506,"if we also consider that the EU is the world 's largest agricultural importer ,"
8507,I would therefore call for more creative approaches from the critics .
8508,we have debated today in plenary the European Union 's responsibility for Afghanistan and have

8521,employment policy is a particularly important area .
8522,"equal access to education and training and , as a consequence , equal pay for"
8523,the candidate countries should also be encouraged to participate in Community programmes for equal opportunities
8524,"statistics show that since the opening up to the East , violence against women in these countries"
8525,trafficking in women is also a brutally booming business .
8526,these forms of violence and trafficking in women must be condemned and combated by all

8528,"secondly , a clear definition of the substitution principle ."
8529,"the definition of this principle varies between Member States , if it exists at all ."
8530,the incorporation into Community law requires consistent and unambiguous wording .
8531,"you said from Copenhagen to Copenhagen , and you said one Europe ."
8532,"I also felt something of a vision in your speech , because you are assuming responsibility for"

8580,"I expect concrete proposals on this from our Parliamentary administration in the very near future , which"

8588,modern technology offers us tools to save energy and use it more efficiently .
8589,"if you do it right , it is actually to everyone ’ s benefit ."
8590,the costs associated with these technical innovations are so low that they pay for themselves within months

8605,I also believe - and that is why we are of course in favour of increasing aid

8673,there are different systems in the Member States of the European Union for achieving adequate participation

8681,I would like to criticise the lack of initiatives on the new challenges in occupational

8683,"perhaps it is a bit because all three of the people responsible – in the Commission ,"
8684,but we also need instruments that involve fathers .
8685,that would be a new approach .
8686,"this agenda is also intended to be a signal to the candidate countries , and I therefore"

8696,let us now find the right steps together and show the flexibility that the rapporteur and
8697,"Turkey is an important strategic partner , but Turkey must also know that it must make the necessary"
8698,the only way to Europe is through the rule of law and respect for human rights .
8699,that is the only chance .
8700,"in this sense , my group will follow closely the new efforts of the Commission and the Council"
8701,I must stress that many of the Union 's programmes are characterised by a time lag

8713,element No 3 is really effective disciplinary procedures .
8714,the Staff Regulations and the Financial Regulation have long provided that in the event of gross negligence
8715,this provision was never applied .
8716,the Commission is now even planning to remove it from the Financial Regulation .
8717,that would be the wrong signal .
8718,we urge the Commission to reconsider such a step .
8719,I would also like to point out that it is important for us to have a proper discussion with

8735,we should expect the Commission to tell us at last where it is taking the money from .

8743,"yes , but without trust , which is based on judgment , we cannot do without it"
8744,we need to know who we can trust .

8765,the Commission considers this to be unacceptable .
8766,"finally , I would like to point out to the rapporteur and all the other Members"
8767,I am voting against the accession of the Republic of Poland to the European Union at this

8776,the objective of Tampere is to strengthen cooperation between the Member States in the fight
8777,"prosecutors , judges and police officers seconded from Member States will coordinate"
8778,close cooperation with Europe and the European Judicial Network is envisaged .

8781,"in other words , countries must not rely on receiving money when disasters happen , and"
8782,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased to see that the Commission"
8783,"I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Pérez Royo , for this"
8784,"I am also pleased that you , Mr Rapporteur , fully support this proposal"
8785,"on the second point , the European Development Bank does not seem to us to be the solution for"
8786,"we therefore call on the Commission to use all sources of information , not just those of the"
8787,"the great death , by the way , does not only take place in freight transport ."
8788,"are you aware that even privately operated passenger transport , such as the Thalys between"
8789,"that means that all European passenger lines are currently in deficit , and that would not change even"
8790,"in other words , we need less ideology and , on the contrary , concrete policies"
8791,"in this budgetary procedure , we have also set the figures for the new Member States for"
8792,"to give just a few figures , a total of EUR 4.8 billion"
8793,EUR 138 million will be available for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants
8794,these are measures that are essential if the benefits of the large internal market are to be used
8795,"in this connection , I would like to point out once again that the Commission has handed over"
8796,"I simply have to ask that , if there is a charge that something has not been handed"
8797,"there is indeed a point of dispute which must be resolved for the future procedure ,"
8798,this issue is still not covered by the agreement because of the personal interests that are
8799,"in your report , you focused on the overall concept ."
8800,this overall approach is an element of the reform package .
8801,"I would also like to mention , however , that specific measures are being prepared for this"
8802,one point that is certainly much more important from a political point of view than from a budget
8803,I am pleased that we in the Committee on Budgets have agreed that we want to

8810,I believe that we have presented a reasonable compromise here .
8811,"we are , however , willing to compromise with the Commission , especially since we assume that only"
8812,"that is why we dare to table this proposal again as a proposal from the PPE group ,"
8813,we hope that we will be able to obtain the necessary support .
8814,the international indifference towards this issue is distressing .

8821,we must see these risks .
8822,"that is why we must also call for the consolidation efforts that have begun , and which are"
8823,"I must also tell you that I am concerned about my home country , Germany , because our"

8827,we need technology that can respond very quickly and very flexibly to the technological revolution .
8828,"I only mention the keyword "" Internet "" here ."
8829,"on the other hand , however , we do not only want to guarantee universal access to all network"
8830,"Furthermore , the Commission has moved on an important point which Parliament already considered essential at the"
8831,"it concerns visa requirements for the associated states which are already very close to accession ,"
8832,Parliament has always been of the opinion that these countries should be free of visa requirements .
8833,we have drawn these conclusions from the fact that these countries have made great progress in the

8836,"apparently , these countries have now also succeeded in convincing the Commission ."
8837,"ladies and gentlemen , I hear in the last debate , and also in the corridors"
8838,Mr Méndez de Vigo addressed him as if this House were now also giving up its

8851,"no matter whether you separate the regulatory and supervisory bodies , whether you liberalise or"

8853,it is therefore important that Parliament approves the programme by a large majority so that we can

8863,"in view of this development , we must ask ourselves whether the European Union , which has"
8864,"in the context of police cooperation , we can say that great progress has been made ."
8865,"we have Europol , and Europol is extremely successful in combating crime ."

8872,"I agree with you that , from the Commission 's point of view , the increased involvement"
8873,we do not refuse trade .
8874,the problem is that the Turkish Cypriots are being prevented by their own authorities –
8875,the Commission cannot change this completely clear legal situation .
8876,we would be committing a clear violation of the law if we were to act otherwise
8877,"what is crucial , however – and I would ask the Commission and the Council to take a decisi"

8881,as regards the non-compliance of certain situations with the Nitrates Directive
8882,this is therefore not something that can be blamed on the individual farmer .
8883,"secondly , we should also demand the same high standards of our neighbouring countries"
8884,now that Iraq no longer has Saddam Hussein as a dictator and is hopefully on the

8903,"if these explanations are not satisfactory , it will be uncomfortable for all"
8904,that is a promise that it will be uncomfortable then !
8905,"there are colleagues in this House who say that when it comes to prosecution ,"
8906,the intelligence services say that this is a violation of human rights .
8907,I have a great deal of understanding for people saying that they do not want services to do
8908,I can understand that .
8909,"that is not my position , but I can understand it ."
8910,"but if someone says that this is illegal , then he is not taking into account the case law"
8911,but let us take this first step together first .
8912,this is for the benefit of the people of Europe !
8913,"thus , a Chechen has really contributed to ensuring that European countries , which"
8914,"this example , as well as the fact that Chechnya is part of the Council of Europe"
8915,"therefore , it is a shame that an unholy alliance of deception and"
8916,the fraud comes in part from the official government propaganda in Moscow .
8917,Self-deception takes place with us .
8918,they refuse to register what is actually happening in Chechnya .
8919,"it is not about individual attacks , but about systematic genocide ."
8920,Mrs Schroedter rightly pointed out that half of the inhabitants were murdered
8921,this is a systematic genocide of the Chechen people for energy and geostrategic interest
8922,we must therefore exert strong pressure and tell the Russians very clearly that the partnership
8923,"if human rights are not respected , there can be no working partnership ."
8924,we must make it clear to our Russian partners that this is a conditio sine qua non for

9111,if you are speculating that the Treaty provisions that have been in force until now
9112,"you did not have to wait , and you will always be assured of Parliament 's support"
9113,"the Commission must start to show courage here , courage against the Council of Ministers ."
9114,"thirdly , the civilian use of airspace must have priority ."
9115,"in a peacefully united Europe , there is no logical reason why a large part of air"

9127,during the most recent visit of the Troika to Algiers on 24 April
9128,the Commission will continue to follow this issue closely in the future .
9129,the association agreement currently being negotiated with Algeria contains a clause on democratic principle

9134,"in principle , this is therefore a concern that should be supported by everyone , especially when"
9135,"here in Strasbourg we also have the European Ombudsman , who is the expression of"
9136,the idea that the European Parliament and the national parliaments should play a central role in the public
9137,I therefore find it surprising that the Commission does not address in its White Paper the call
9138,"an open convention to draw up the decision-making basis for the Council , in which the Commission"
9139,"in this context , I was surprised that there are abuses which the groups are no longer"
9140,"I believe that the attempt to postpone all this and say , let us wait another year until"

9163,"where large and long-term investments are necessary to achieve EU standards , it should"
9164,this legislation also helps to curb a trend towards which I am increasingly skeptical
9165,"this is the tendency to move to out-of-court dispute settlement procedures ,"
9166,this is a development that actually runs counter to the idea of the rule of law .
9167,this is a development – and I am saying this in this House – which also runs counter
9168,anything that deviates from these processes no longer corresponds to the original image of the

9175,"ultimately , however , I must say that what we need , what the citizens need , is"
9176,this is not on the agenda at the moment ; it must be dealt with on a sector

9179,we are concerned about constructive cooperation .
9180,"that is why , Mr President-in-Office , I am waiting for a political declaration"

9193,"Madam President , I believe that it is indeed necessary for the European Parliament , the Council"
9194,I find it unacceptable that we should act as a decoration for the national parliaments .
9195,in the Committee on Internal Affairs we have been very critical of the composition of this planne
9196,I think that is scandalous !
9197,the Council gives itself a mandate and then declares that it cannot deviate from that manda
9198,I think that is late absolutism !
9199,I therefore believe that we should use today to re-parliamentarise this procedure .
9200,the European citizens are represented by the European Parliament .
9201,"if the national parliaments cooperate , all the better ."
9202,"but I really ask you , as the Council , to seek dialogue with the European Parliament on this"

9226,"we cannot therefore unify criminal law , the code of criminal procedure , the training of prose"
9227,we can only coordinate here .

9234,I congratulate the rapporteur .
9235,there is only one point on which I do not agree with her .
9236,it has proposed to use Luxembourg as its seat .
9237,"as an Austrian , who is also aware that the European Union is about to enlarge"
9238,the second point concerns finance .
9239,I would like to be reminded by representatives of the budgetary authority that the Commission

9241,"until that is the case , the Commission will stick strictly to the guidelines that we"
9242,"and I tell you , that is enough ."
9243,it would be completely pointless to make considerably more money available because we have already reached the

9245,"in terms of their gross national product , the future new Member States will receive considerably more a"
9246,"in accordance with the agreement between Parliament and the Council , we have not amended the Council"
9247,I would like to draw the Council 's attention to the fact that the Council 's budget
9248,"in the field of foreign and security policy in particular , the Council should continue to ensure that this"
9249,program expenditure has no place in the Council 's budget .
9250,this must be permanently ensured in the Commission budget .
9251,"as part of the budgetary authority , we will continue to keep a close eye on this ."
9252,the responsibility for carrying out the controls is clearly regulated .
9253,it is the responsibility of the Member States .
9254,"however , Community financial support is essential , especially in terms of the same level of control ."
9255,"we need Community support to ensure that efficient , modern controls are possible in the future"
9256,I am consciously saying 'modern ' because we need - and here the Commission has set the

9259,when you said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that in the Danube
9260,you write in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union are right to expect
9261,"Mr Prodi , you do not know what you are talking about !"
9262,the European Union 's legislation on food is the most ambitious in the world !
9263,what is lacking and what is not working is implementation in the Member States and monitoring .
9264,"take your task as President of the Commission seriously at last , by pulling the Member States"
9265,"they should not always only cultivate hobbies , but do the daily normal work ."
9266,that is what we expect from you in the next five years !
9267,"let me say briefly , Mr Garriga Polledo , that the categories of the financial"

9271,"we remember that in 1998 , which is not long ago , everyone in this"
9272,"now Austria has voted , and I think it makes no sense to insult the voters ."
9273,it should also be recalled that there have been negotiations with the SPÖ .
9274,"I regret that they have not succeeded , but why have they not succeeded ?"
9275,because the trade union-oriented part of the SPÖ was not prepared to support what
9276,I would like to highlight one more point .
9277,the previous speaker has pointed out very clearly - and as a member of the Committee on
9278,I have always promised my consumers and my citizens that we will provide a standard whereby
9279,I think we have to go a little further along this path .
9280,"I would like to emphasise precisely what the previous speaker , Mrs Hieronymi ,"
9281,perhaps the Commission and the Council can jump a little bit further over the small shadow of

9283,I am closing my remarks and I would like to point out that I have kept to

9285,"a letter from the Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , Mr Hatzida"
9286,"it is to be hoped that , as the Commission has promised , the funds that have"
9287,I am the only one who lacks faith that this will really happen .
9288,it is also almost impossible for the Commission to cut the funds on its own initiative and then
9289,I would advise that we should clarify this discrepancy .
9290,"that is your job , Madam President ."
9291,we have nothing to vote on until you have clarified this with the Committee on Legal Affairs .
9292,"Mr Deprez , if I remember correctly , wanted to postpone his report ."
9293,now I do not know why I am given the floor first .
9294,"he , as rapporteur , has not yet given reasons for why he wants this post"
9295,it would therefore be fair if you gave him the floor first .
9296,I will then give my opinion and that of my group .
9297,"the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2 , 4 and 10 , which"
9298,"amendment No 5 , which calls for general guidelines which only define the essential elements"
9299,the Commission is open to the possibility of taking up this idea in the wording of Article
9300,"amendments Nos 18 and 24 , first part , which reduce the period"
9301,these are the amendments that the Commission can accept .
9302,"I would also like to thank the Commission , President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen ."
9303,"what the Commission is doing is not spectacular , but it is an effort that is made every"
9304,"the success in Copenhagen , with your great commitment , was only possible because the Commission and we"
9305,we have to see that this is a very delicate matter .
9306,"after all , we have no uniform criminal law in Europe ."
9307,"personally , I believe that we will never have such a uniform criminal law ."
9308,"this is not necessarily a disadvantage , because even the United States of America , which is"
9309,there are states that have the death penalty and others that do not have the death penalty .
9310,"in this respect , the EU is even much more uniform ."
9311,we would not have room for anyone who knows the death penalty .
9312,"yes , now listen for a moment !"
9313,we exchange arguments and each one takes the other seriously .
9314,"if you are fighting for human rights , then listen to the Chairman of the PPE-"

9316,"later this year , we intend to present a long-term reconstruction plan to the European"
9317,"once this proposal has been adopted by the Council , Member States will be able to pay"

9321,"Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to refer to Mr Corbett'"
9322,I say on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party / European Democrats
9323,"what we need , of course , Mr Bolkestein , are clear answers from you ."
9324,how do you intend to ensure that the US authorities only receive the data they need to
9325,"how do you intend to ensure that the Americans , including in the case of company data"
9326,you must ensure this by making clear agreements with the Americans .
9327,how can the much-claimed sense of Europe be improved if the concerns of the

9329,many people still do not see the port into which the European Union is supposed to go .
9330,I think that careful and deliberate steps are more sensible than possible hasty marches to

9389,this report makes it clear that we need a reform of additives .
9390,it is not acceptable that we should put hundreds of additives on the market just because

9589,"it is not enough to say , okay , we have a great system now , but nobody"

9701,we can therefore safely assume that Cyprus will be part of the first round of accession
9702,the European Union is sending election observers to that country .
9703,"this is sensible if free opportunities for work are guaranteed , and the government of the country must"
9704,all these demands are not intended to be an unacceptable interference in the internal
9705,this shows the contradiction .
9706,I also find it more than shameful that loyalty to Mr Blair is being used
9707,I would like to emphasise once again that we have always said that this is what is
9708,we have the alternative possibility of achieving the same with adult stem cells .
9709,"of course , we are also committed to all the media and all the minorities in Kosovo"
9710,"firstly , victim protection ."
9711,"in the past decades , well-known global NGOs have taken care of criminals"
9712,"unfortunately , we have often forgotten and left the victims of their crimes"
9713,"even today , far from all Member States guarantee comprehensive victim protection , especially for third-"

9716,"yesterday , the General Affairs Council gave the Presidency and the Commission a clear mandate ,"
9717,"there will not be a package of proposals that will then be valid for everyone , but we"
9718,"we can do this here because , immediately after the European Council in Brussels , we"

9722,we need a broad democratic debate on this historic project .
9723,this was the basic idea I wanted to share in the interview .
9724,it implicitly follows that we will not put any further conditions .
9725,"if the reform process is now to continue , which I very much welcome , and if we are"
9726,that must not happen .
9727,this would have all the negative consequences that several speakers have described as the result of
9728,the Commission 's decision to stop funding the environmental organisation Globe is just as lacking
9729,this is in no way understandable and therefore appears absolutely arbitrary .
9730,"incidentally , Globe has not been paid the approved funds in the current financial year"
9731,"but NGOs also need planning security , for example , to be able to continue paying office"
9732,what the Commission is doing here is anti-social .
9733,"where there is political will , Commissioner , a way can always be found , or a different budget"

9735,"unfortunately , the South Caucasus region is not included , although with Romania 's"

9738,there is also no indication of the proportion of investment in gross domestic product that must be achieve
9739,"the current upward trend is encouraging , especially as the economy in Germany and Italy ,"
9740,this shows us very clearly the interdependence and interlinking of the European economies
9741,that is why the date of 1 November has come out for the next Commission .
9742,"that is the minimum time required to appoint a new Commission President , to have him confirmed"
9743,that is the whole background .
9744,"I think we can discuss this reasonably with each other and , as I said , the Commission"

9779,"secondly , I would like to ask you when you think the Council will or could formally"
9780,do we not have a responsibility to consider how we can combat this policy ?
9781,Europe is a community of law .
9782,"the principles we have to defend include democracy , respect for human rights and the rule of law"
9783,it is a democratic requirement that we do not like election decisions but that we must respect
9784,it is a matter of the rule of law that the Presidency does not speak as it has

9801,he must explain how the EU will continue to be politically capable of action and flexible .

9803,because of the large number of individual amendments – including those from Parliament – the two large

9823,the starting point for this report on the common foreign and security policy is the dramatic events surrounding

9825,Lloyd 's had recruited Names without making these people aware of the fact that they

9827,many have lost their wealth and some their only pension .
9828,"not only British , but also Belgians and Germans ."

9830,"now one could coldly say : “ Well , you were unlucky ! ”"
9831,"but no , these people trusted that the insurance market was regulated and that UK and EU"
9832,we must ensure that citizens are able to exercise their rights in this Europe .
9833,that is why the Charter must become binding .
9834,"we must ensure that the European Union can take decisions where it has competence , so that"
9835,we must make this European Union democratic .

9839,these are the crucial measures that we must put through in this Intergovernmental Conference !

9844,the ECB proposal respects this common sense .
9845,we are not asking the Commission to have a say in the nuclear powers of Great Britain
9846,"but when it comes to the budget , the European Union 's own budget , you are the"
9847,we should also enforce and defend this !

9853,"most Member States have established regulators , but one has not ."
9854,"we note that in those countries where regulators have been set up , not only large consumers"
9855,perhaps we should consider again whether the model of negotiated network access is the right one
9856,I would point out that the European Union has been a donor of non-reimburs
9857,on the basis of the new framework for cooperation between the EU and Central America adopted
9858,"it is in the rich nations , and particularly in the United States , which have benefit"
9859,"with the loss of foreign policy as a whole , the temptation to replace it with foreign trade"

9871,I therefore support the amendments which provide for punishment of those guilty
9872,"the Albanian doctor , Flora Brovina , who was sentenced in Niš on 13"
9873,she was sentenced because as a doctor she helped wounded people – wherever they came
9874,she was neither a terrorist nor an UCK activist !
9875,but no one helps this woman to get out of prison .
9876,"from now on , women will gradually gain equal opportunities in terms of access to employment"
9877,they need a seat and a voice in parliament and government .
9878,I am convinced that they will be able to build their own organisations to influence economic and

9899,I would urge you to continue with the vote .
9900,we are suffering from the fact that agendas are constantly changed or postponed at

9902,my opinion – yours may be different – is that you should correct mistakes and not try

9908,"in recent years , Europe has tried to leave the role of political mediator to the United States"
9909,perhaps this was a reaction to Europe ’ s chaotic and uncoordinated political position
9910,"I also believe that an extension to Macedonia is really necessary , because the difficult political processes"
9911,this process is far from complete .
9912,the laws must be implemented so that the Albanian citizens can see that they really benefit from
9913,"the Macedonian inhabitants of the region should see that it is precisely about them , if"
9914,we agree with everything and we also agree with the reservations mentioned by Mr Färm .
9915,"I do , however , think that the Commission is very well aware of all this and certainly"
9916,we want not only an expanded agenda but also an improved method for drawing up this
9917,"in the interests of the citizens , greater transparency must be guaranteed in the political"
9918,that is why we call for full involvement of Parliament at all levels .
9919,"I believe that this aspect must also be mentioned , especially in connection with Turkey ."
9920,let me make one final point .

9927,there are social science institutes that can conduct this study .
9928,"we as Parliament , just like you , must have a well-founded basis for decisions"
9929,"I therefore urge you to make this experiment , which no one has taken seriously ,"
9930,I therefore support the proposal to incorporate the whole matter into the directive in terms of

9935,"my group will re-table this passage , as well as a few others , in an a"
9936,"and please remember , this is common policy that we have agreed ."
9937,"so you can correct your mistake in committee tomorrow , or you will have to make it clear"
9938,you have to think about it .

9979,"in fact , the majority of those who have taken part in the debate , in the consultation"
9980,"as we all know , governments have been more reserved in their comments than the legal profession"

9985,I will give you the example of what I announced earlier :
9986,I am pleased that the Commission has been investigating for some time the extent to which

9988,"in the committee , I have now formulated a passage in my draft report which the Commission"
9989,this was eradicated by the majority in the committee in the vote .
9990,the Hieronymi report presents this in a welcome way .

9993,"Countering this is a requirement for safeguarding freedom of information , diversity of opinion and"
9994,"I believe that this is a step towards transparency and control of foreign , security and defence"
9995,this shows the development of the European Union as a whole since the Treaty of Amsterdam and the
9996,it also shows the need for parliamentary control which is connected with this .
9997,I therefore sincerely ask the House to support this project .
9998,many things have gone wrong in the discussion of these new forms of terrorism .
9999,"there was no discussion about the safety of citizens who were innocently exposed to violence ,"
10000,"there has also been too little discussion about the background of the supporting environment , the financial sources"

10354,"given the scepticism that has been expressed , we must also be clear about what"
10355,it will only become exciting from 2006 !
10356,we then want to know from the Commission how the universal service will be financed .
10357,"there is no blank cheque , but we will receive a study ."
10358,"there is no automaticity , but we want to know very precisely – because that is the"
10359,this will not be the case until 2006 .
10360,"I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Ferber , because I think he has already"
10361,"secondly , I would like to say that there are many urgent matters which deserve to"
10362,"the urgent question on the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia , based"
10363,because the occasion is actually a purely personal matter of Professor Pelinka .
10364,his resignation from the board of directors of this company was voluntary .
10365,the real reason was that he refused to fulfil a self-evident duty which is
10366,what this has to do with the European Parliament is beyond question .
10367,"we cannot rely on cross-border neighbourhood aid in the future , as"
10368,it was done on a voluntary basis in an exemplary manner .
10369,it is also a good and important expression of solidarity .
10370,but it is not a European solution in itself .
10371,the European Union must certainly accept its responsibility for its citizens in this respect .
10372,the Commission should therefore quickly start thinking about instruments for rapid and effective disaster relief .
10373,we expect solutions soon .
10374,these proposals can be unconventional and bold .
10375,there will certainly be no shortage of support from the European Parliament .
10376,so much for the necessary trip into the future .
10377,"until the results of the comprehensive review I have announced , which will also take account"
10378,I say this because these amendments go far beyond the very narrowly defined specific

10382,that is why I immediately took the initiative with my services to draw up an action

10384,Commissioner Verheugen has once again put these expectations into perspective .
10385,"he spoke of democracy , the rule of law and the protection of minorities as three basic elements"
10386,the same applies if a 35-year-old employee has a car accident and

10389,"firstly , I do not understand why the legal instrument of a directive has been chosen"
10390,the text is sufficiently concrete .
10391,"since a directive requires national transposition , the application of the legal act is delayed"
10392,"in addition , this act replaces , among other things , Regulation 1091 /"
10393,"for this reason too , the legal instrument of a regulation is the more appropriate means ."
10394,let me get to the point right away :
10395,"fisheries monitoring is not everything , but without monitoring everything is nothing ."
10396,"we know from daily experience that without real and effective control , the European fisheries policy would"
10397,we need progress and adaptation to modern developments in this area .
10398,a conference organised by the Commission in Brussels last October also drew attention to the international
10399,we also need a global approach .
10400,the Commission 's proposals on this matter are just as correct as the statements in the
10401,employers of course also want social acceptance .
10402,"the main reason for using temporary workers , as our foundation in Dublin has found out , is not"
10403,"this is exactly what the European directive , with additions by Ike van den Burg ,"
10404,the necessary flexibility is also ensured by collective bargaining .
10405,let us show that social Europe does exist when we adopt this legislation tomorrow !
10406,I believe that it is very important for the Council to make it clear that payments are the
10407,there are two ways to do this with these payments .
10408,"Mr Elles said that we could of course reduce commitments and keep payments , and then"
10409,"this means , however , that we must take our policies under the microscope and reduce them"
10410,I will tell you quite frankly that the basis for the interinstitutional agreement and the financial
10411,they are important to us !
10412,"not only have they been , but they are still important today under other conditions of European policy ,"
10413,the Commission will of course gladly comply with the request of the Committee on Budgetary Control
10414,"we have also agreed to follow the suggestion of the rapporteur , Mr Casaca , to"
10415,it should be remembered that only 20 % of the budget is managed by the
10416,the Commission welcomes the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control recommends discharge for the

10427,"Commissioner Vitorino , if Mr Schily , the German Minister of the Interior , who is not"
10428,"at this point , I would like to thank all those who helped to clean up , who"
10429,I would also like to ask the Commission not to forget the Czech Republic and Slovakia in all
10430,the damage is enormous there and the possibilities that the Länder have are perhaps not
10431,legal bases must be created to curb these negative developments .
10432,"I welcome the fact that WADA is now taking action , that it exists to combat the"
10433,action must be taken against excessive violence and racism in sport in order to protect athletes
10434,top athletes could also contribute more to this and emphasize it more clearly than
10435,my last point is that the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development is being final
10436,"I believe that we must press very hard for a solution to be found , especially for the transport"
10437,we need new approaches in the Sixth Framework Programme for Research .
10438,we know that congestion will be one of the main issues in the coming years .
10439,I believe that we need intelligent solutions that will help us to ensure the mobility of the population
10440,we should therefore also be increasingly focusing on our own research programmes for aviation
10441,"without making any judgment , I believe that both countries , India and Pakistan , must"
10442,"some with repeated border violations , others with repeatedly proven discrimination against sections"
10443,"I do not want to judge this , I do not want to put it on the scale ,"
10444,I have already referred on several occasions to our discussion in the Convention in this connection .
10445,"for us , it is about making it clear to the European public who is exercising legislative"
10446,"that does not mean that the work on the Corbett report is superfluous , quite the"
10447,"until we have secured this result at constitutional level and then implemented it ,"
10448,"in this respect , we not only congratulate the rapporteur , but we also hope that"

10451,"therefore , Parliament , and in particular the rapporteur – in other words myself – have made"
10452,"this was not possible at the time , because the Council could not agree on what it really wanted"
10453,"otherwise , we will become increasingly confused in a thicket of countless different regulation"
10454,"in future , we must make much more efforts than in the past to achieve a uniform framework"
10455,"at the same time , it is unfortunately also ignored that the Schengen Convention has so"
10456,"I have therefore proposed some systematic clarifications , which have received broad support in"
10457,we should therefore have the courage to achieve real new developments and progress in this Schengen

10459,"let me once again thank my colleagues , you , Commissioner , and your staff , who"
10460,I was proud of this European House and would be pleased if this could be continued in the
10461,I would like us to be able to prepare properly for a debate on the five-year
10462,you cannot prepare yourself if you hear a statement here and do not know what the content of such
10463,that is why we recommend - and I have the impression that the Commission is also open to this
10464,"therefore , there is also a sensible factual context that advises us to hold the debate"
10465,that is why my group strongly rejects the proposal of the Socialist Group .
10466,these databases to be created are also part of the system for the identification and registration of

10468,it was also important for us to achieve improvements in terms of co-determination .

10470,"as regards biometric risks , we support the rapporteur 's wording ."
10471,"we have made a major turn around here , but I think it is in everyone 's interest"
10472,"in this sense , Mr Duisenberg , I would like to thank you for your good and"
10473,a final word on subsidiarity .
10474,"municipal autonomy is not served by declaring public transport a res extra commertium ,"
10475,"unfortunately , this is not serving the citizens either , because it is they who ultimate"
10476,therefore – controlled competition and high standards also for local public transport !
10477,"thirdly , in many countries there are already strict obligations to provide advice and information ,"
10478,insurance companies and credit institutions are subject to supervisory and reporting obligations and clear creditworth

10483,"we want , for many good reasons and not least for the sake of securing lasting"
10484,"this should have been our signal today , in a few words ."
10485,my final comment concerns a point where the art of wording also plays a role .
10486,"we always talk about the Kurdish question , but we do not talk about the Kurdish people ."
10487,they are a people of 12 to 20 million who cannot enjoy their freedoms
10488,we must work towards this .

10495,we are seeing today that this European market is increasingly being threatened by non-

10511,"however , the proposal does not go far enough ."
10512,"it is , in a sense , three steps forward and then one and a half back ."
10513,our amendments are to keep to the three steps forward and to avoid the steps backwards
10514,"in this sense , I ask you to give your approval and the Commission and the Council of"
10515,"in connection with the reform , I would firstly like to say that it will remain up to"

10521,"the regulation will help to create greater transparency in the financing of political work , great"

10523,"we need legal bases for food hygiene which , firstly , can be easily applied by"
10524,the legal form regulation is essential for this .
10525,Parliament will not allow any change in this respect .

10533,"of course , Yasser Arafat is the elected president of Palestine ."
10534,"if we do not accept him as a partner in the dialogue , there can be no peace ,"
10535,that is why we call on Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat to begin peace talks
10536,"all those who are promoting this , such as Javier Solana , Chris Patten and others"
10537,"finally , I would like to express my thanks to Mrs Angelilli , not only for her"
10538,I admit that this issue is far too serious .
10539,"we can be very emotional this morning about this BSE issue , but that does not help"
10540,"it is also of little help if we , as MEPs , point to the current violations"
10541,"infringement is an important issue for us all in European politics , but as a Member"

10574,I would like to take up a point made by the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control
10575,I can only point out that the legal basis of OLAF has changed the procedure .
10576,the legal basis of OLAF makes it quite clear that the Director of OLAF is responsible
10577,I believe that we will have to discuss this with the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Director
10578,she does not have more information than you do on the question of which investigations are at what
10579,we therefore need to talk to the Director of OLAF about this .

10584,"this development is complementary to NATO , which will continue to be responsible for collective security"
10585,this activity-based approach aims to better align resources with political priorities .
10586,"it is an instrument for estimating costs more accurately , for better recording them , and it"
10587,it was also a major concern of Parliament to make political priorities more clearly identifiable .
10588,"so again , transparency is the goal , and I believe we are achieving that goal ."
10589,"on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , we also request that this initiative by the"

10591,it has also raised more questions than it has given explanations from a legal point of

10595,"on the other hand , the European Works Councils usually meet only once a year ."
10596,"at least two meetings per year , if not three , must take place ."
10597,they need to get to know each other better .
10598,they also have to understand the most diverse mentalities .
10599,this is the first prerequisite for action based on solidarity and certainly sustainable
10600,not even 10 % are represented there .
10601,"a lot of motivational work is needed in companies , and this must be expressed in concrete"
10602,what are the most important areas that we can really have ?
10603,we must do what the Commission is also calling for .
10604,"we must make the entire World Trade Organisation more open , more democratic and more transparent , and"
10605,"we need to look at production methods that are not related to products , and we need to see"

10614,these are funds that will be used for 25 or more Member States at a later date

10617,"in conclusion , I would like to emphasise that I am extremely pleased that this"

10624,in the international competition she has improved !
10625,no convinced European can seriously want Parliament 's rights to be reduced in favour
10626,"above all , our citizens do not want that ."
10627,the attitude of Austrian artists to the introduction of a resale right is negative .
10628,the resale right is of great economic disadvantage to them because it inevitably lowers the

10641,this risks distorting competition to the detriment of the agricultural alcohol market
10642,"Commissioner , you spoke of the interministerial committee ."
10643,"that is correct , many structures are being built ."
10644,I have known this since 1995 in Turkey .
10645,"when they have to do something , they start with committees , with commissions , interministeri"
10646,"the structures are fantastic , we can all agree ."
10647,but nothing is done .
10648,"it would have been very easy , for example , to abolish Article 312 of"
10649,it ’ s that easy to take the first steps !
10650,"as I have said on previous occasions , we all agree that there is a chronic deficit of"
10651,I therefore believe that we need an answer to the following questions .
10652,"firstly , does the European Union need its own nut production ?"
10653,"secondly , do nuts play a multifunctional role ?"
10654,"thirdly , should the EU continue to invest in the preservation of nut production ?"
10655,"fourthly , if so , in what form ?"
10656,"the coasts are not urban areas , but today about one third of the EU population lives in"
10657,"for a fragile ecosystem like the coasts , this means danger ."
10658,"but the socio-economic problems have also grown , as the coastal regions are far away"
10659,I would just like to remind you of the lack of infrastructure connections in the coast
10660,we must therefore do something for the coasts of Europe .
10661,our Parliament has made a number of proposals to the Commission over the years and is now waiting
10662,the tasks on the priority list should be tackled step by step .
10663,"first and foremost , the fundamental rights of children are to be included in the new Treaty"
10664,"secondly , the use of the Daphne programme as a first step , as a first instrument"
10665,"thirdly , the situation of girls , which must be given special attention in all policy areas ,"
10666,"fourthly , we must do everything we can to keep children out of wars – both"
10667,child soldiers must no longer occur anywhere in the world .
10668,we have found a great willingness to cooperate on the part of the Commission and its officials
10669,"nevertheless , I would like to emphasise once again that it was right to request"
10670,the economic policy guidelines are intended to translate this noble objective into concrete policie
10671,"the Commission 's recommendations , however , do not sufficiently achieve this ."
10672,the Commission is not guided by such motives when it comes to ensuring optimal management
10673,"this is not about the South or the North , but about putting together in one section those"
10674,this ensures that they are managed in a uniform and coherent manner .

10705,I can only advise them to close the barrel they have opened before they fall into it and
10706,Mr Voggenhuber has mentioned that the issue of national parliaments is being brought up
10707,a clear delimitation of competences would help .
10708,the Convention is also called upon to ensure that parliamentarians are not played out against each other
10709,my group supports the recommendation on the ACP-EC partnership agreement .
10710,we welcome the fact that the Union 's relations with the ACP countries have now reached a
10711,the Cotonou Agreement has opened up new areas of cooperation through direct trade exchanges
10712,it is all the more strange that this agreement has only been ratified by two of the

10714,the Commission has also provided humanitarian aid throughout the conflict .
10715,"the European Union is , as we all know , the largest donor ."
10716,we have provided financial assistance to the countries most affected by the influx of displaced person
10717,we have no room for cheap populism here .
10718,the large groups have a responsibility for this whole House and we are trying to live up to

10720,"the food waste is not being regulated here , but the Commission should submit its own legislative"

10723,there are both positions .
10724,that is why I tabled the proposal at the time .
10725,"Mrs Paulsen , your compromise proposal is good ."
10726,"I will table an oral amendment tomorrow , in which I will adjust my amend"
10727,"then , in my opinion , they are compatible and we can adopt them as they are ."
10728,then we have a reasonable solution .
10729,"I hope that , on your initiative , Mr Byrne , we will soon have it ."
10730,"then we will get back together again , and we will have fun again ."
10731,"politics is not a dirty business , it is a lot of fun !"
10732,I would also like to mention tobacco cultivation in the Union .
10733,subsidies for tobacco cultivation are structural aid .
10734,they are to be abolished without any alternative for the farmers .
10735,80 % of the tobacco needs are already being imported .
10736,"so when we talk about abolishing subsidies , we must think globally , otherwise only"
10737,"jobs were lost , cultural landscapes were devastated ."
10738,but that would not mean less smoking .
10739,international regulations must be pursued in this area .
10740,"( de ) Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report ."
10741,"on behalf of our group , I would like to repeat what I said on 1"

10751,"this culminated in the demand of the health minister of the Grey Wolves , MHP ,"
10752,we cannot accept such contempt for human beings without objection .

10755,the Commission presents a broad approach to reform .
10756,there is still considerable need for clarification and discussion on many topics .
10757,the Brussels summit of 24-25 October has set the financial framework
10758,we must now set the course in good time for how agricultural policy should be structured
10759,Mr Daul 's motion for a resolution was voted on as a compromise across
10760,I thank Joseph Daul for his excellent work and also for his willingness to compromise .
10761,I therefore ask my fellow Members to put this motion for a resolution forward in

10763,that is what we want .

10769,the Commission must urgently talk to the World Trade Organisation about the authorisation of export subsidies
10770,"thirdly , we must do everything possible to prevent the dangers of fungal infestations"
10771,"I would also like to highlight something that I really enjoyed in Madrid , namely a parallel"
10772,"this is the third time that we have had a meeting between entrepreneurs , business associations"
10773,"we need an economic and technological dialogue between Latin America and Europe , similar to what we have"
10774,perhaps the Commission can also play its part in this .
10775,"we are committed to a climate tax on a national basis , to achieve the goal , without"
10776,"this does not mean introducing a European tax , but calling for harmonisation of national tax"
10777,the international competitiveness is to be sustainably strengthened .
10778,energy security is an economic basis .
10779,"Nepal - I know it very well - is one of the poorest countries in the world ,"
10780,it is currently deprived of its main source of income in tourism .
10781,why ?
10782,"in view of the lack of security in this beautiful Himalayan region , thousands of"
10783,"finally , I would like to mention a point that is particularly important to us Social Democrat"
10784,nor must the responsibility or the costs of removing damage and restoring the environment be passed
10785,no way !
10786,the polluter pays principle must always apply to everyone .
10787,that is why we have introduced a paragraph in Articles 4 and 5 as a supplement
10788,the aim of this amendment is to allow the competent authority to order the necess

10793,"since my speaking time has already run out , I would just like to add that we are"
10794,Mr Putin himself has said that Mr Babitsky was taken into custody by the Russian secret
10795,he himself said he made the case a chief 's matter .
10796,he claimed that he had the case under control .
10797,"then we hear that he has allegedly handed over the case , which is , so"
10798,which state would hand over its own citizens to people it considers to be dangerous terrorist
10799,"after initial confusion , there is a clear denial from the Chechen side ."
10800,Russian civil rights activists and opposition members of the Russian democratic forces have clearly pointed
10801,there is much unsolved in this case .

10809,"it is a pilot project involving three countries - Germany , Austria and Italy - which run"
10810,"however , it is not enough for the project to run only until 2005,"
10811,"the Italian Government has expressed its positive attitude through Minister Buttiglione , who was"

10813,some of you in this House and your staff have experienced this painfully in the immediate

10815,that is why I have proposed that the contact point be located in the secretariat of the

10817,"Furthermore , I made the defined objectives and the legal basis more concrete ."
10818,"although I agree with the Commission 's proposals in principle , there are a number of points"
10819,I will briefly explain some of these points .
10820,many critics of the White Paper argue that decentralisation would jeopardise the co
10821,"national authorities , and in particular the courts , are not yet in a position to play"
10822,"if you had listened to me , it would have been done long ago !"
10823,the second important issue is the national guaranteed quantities .
10824,"given the well-known difficulties in controlling the results of the harvest ,"
10825,"the Commission proposal limits the risk of abuse to the processing stage , without the need to"
10826,I am willing - and it may be quite sensible - to consider transferring funds from the first
10827,"to the great delight of the Member States , large sums of money are also returned"
10828,the 2002 agricultural budget lines are currently being used to about 8
10829,reality shows that there is a need for better management and for the best possible use of
10830,"to mention the example of export refunds once again , a lot could be done here too ."
10831,"I am not unaware , Commissioner Vitorino , of the European Union 's dialogue with China"
10832,I also do not underestimate China ’ s role as a WTO member and as a
10833,there are efforts underway to be more sensitive in dealing with important trading partners .
10834,"I bet that one day the old guard of unscrupulous , centralist-oriented"
10835,but we cannot wait until that happens one day .
10836,we cannot stand by and watch these many people suffering from psychological and physical violence .
10837,we have an image problem with the parties to the conflict in the many hotspots of the
10838,this cannot be managed only with new departments and financial plans .
10839,what we therefore still lack is a convincing intention to take on greater international responsibilit

10843,"Mr President , of course we have a duty to support the people of East Timor in their quest"
10844,but what should this support look like ?
10845,we Europeans cannot be merely teachers in a conflict in South-East Asia .
10846,we are not building confidence with those men in Asia who would be important partners in democrat

10854,the annual discussions on the financial management of the Union may give the impression that nothing is going
10855,it is the Court of Auditors itself which stresses how fundamental and comprehensive the Commission
10856,the key point here is that financial management should finally be brought into line with the reality of a
10857,responsibility for ex-ante control of financial transactions has been transferred to the operation

10863,"it depends on the willingness to take a global view , on the perception of overall"
10864,that is why the European Union must act now .
10865,the Directive on the definition of facilitation of illegal entry and illegal stay defines a legal

10869,"in order to increase the effectiveness of individual measures , the number of projects for Urban II"
10870,"I believe it is important not to keep this arbitrarily set numerical limit rigidly ,"
10871,"however , we must ensure that in small Member States , in particular , it is not just district"
10872,"in that case , URBAN II would be a drop in the ocean , of doubtful"
10873,the forthcoming reform of the capital requirements for credit institutions and investment firms has far-

10875,"if we consider how much the European economy , and above all our medium-sized economy ,"
10876,this has been demonstrated in particular by the very intense debate on external ratings .
10877,"I therefore welcome this report once again in the European Parliament 's plenary , because the"
10878,"Argentina has made efforts in recent years to increase public spending on research and technology , but it"
10879,0.5 % of gross domestic product is spent on research .
10880,"that is far too little , although it is probably still one of the countries in Latin America"
10881,but that is not how you can cope with the 21st century .
10882,"in this respect , cooperation between Argentina and the European Union is also an encouragement to the"
10883,I just recall this aspect to make it clear how complicated and dangerous unilateralism
10884,"that is why , Mr Van Orden , Europeans are united in saying no to unilateralism"

10889,this caused the corresponding delay in the subsequent Court of Auditors report .
10890,"this is in fact inexcusable , especially since this was an evaluation of a report"
10891,"as regards legislation , we are supporting the revision of the directive on equal"
10892,"that is exactly what you have just highlighted , and it will be our common concern to"
10893,the revision of the equal treatment directives is intended to contribute to simplification and
10894,"Mr President , after intensive negotiations and a very good work by Mr Busk ,"
10895,"on behalf of my group , I would like to thank him and Mr Maat for their work"
10896,I think that the compromise proposals that have been negotiated are a further step towards
10897,it is and remains just a compromise .
10898,"optimal demands , often emotionally presented , are obvious , but cannot be"
10899,"on the subject of ethics and research , I would like to say that I am very much"
10900,these were already part of the package in the Caudron report and could point in a positive direction
10901,"so it is a positive , constructive approach ."
10902,"finally , I would like to highlight three points on which , after many discussions with those"
10903,"firstly , in the event of a conflict , the welfare of the child must come first"
10904,"secondly , there must be no discrimination in the event of a dispute ."
10905,the law must offer everyone in every part of the European Union a comparably high level of individual
10906,"thirdly , the jurisdiction of the courts must be clear and manageable ."
10907,recognition and enforcement of decisions must not be used as a weapon of revenge
10908,I think the Commission agrees with me and I would like to thank all those who have made
10909,"in addition , for the first time in this House , I would like to pay tribute to"
10910,I would like to encourage you to raise our voices clearly : we stand for Europe
10911,if you continue to succeed – hopefully even more in Gothenburg than in Stockholm –
10912,I wish you and us this success .
10913,"in conclusion , I would like to say that this reform of competition policy which we are initi"
10914,"the Commission and Parliament must make it clear more than ever that competition policy , competition between companies and"
10915,this point of departure shows that we are concerned about the same issues .
10916,multifunctionality is also at the heart of the new rural development policy .
10917,it aims to promote an agriculture that recognises all the functions and all the services
10918,I believe that this is a case of trade policy being carried out on the backs of

10922,"Parliament is therefore right to use this report to highlight the problem , which is often shame"
10923,"but the best rules are useless if they are not followed , or not properly ."
10924,monitoring and control is a major problem .
10925,"however , they are again the exclusive competence of the Member States ."
10926,we must therefore work together to press them to ensure that the rules are applied correctly .
10927,"in addition , objective , reliable and comparable data on the causes and circumstances of"

10940,"we all enjoy the new achievements of our time : travel , the Internet , mobile phones"

10952,there are now first signs that the bank wants to open its books .
10953,"however , I do not think they are sufficient and there is still a lack of confi"
10954,"this mistrust is further heightened by the way in which Mr Blak , the rapporteur"
10955,"in this connection , I would like to express my thanks once again for the preparatory work of"
10956,but it is also about questions of cooperation .
10957,"we need a definition of the precise responsibilities between the ECB , the national central bank"
10958,I also wonder whether it would not be necessary to create an interinstitutional or EU body
10959,this also includes the creation of an early warning system that operates 24 hours a

10961,"in addition , in November 2001 , the Commission presented a proposal for a"

10964,"on services , we want further liberalisation of services ."
10965,"however , it must not be a one-way street in the area of the industrialised countries"
10966,"in the case of intellectual property , we want biodiversity to be respected and"
10967,the experience of recent months shows that Europe must also organise itself more strongly in the field

10976,"women are particularly underrepresented in academic teaching in Germany , with 9 % ."
10977,the highest figures were in Finland at 36 % .
10978,it is therefore in the European interest and brings added value if women are involved in research
10979,the Commission welcomes the report 's proposal to specify the procedures that the persons

10994,"Mr President , sometimes it is easier to congratulate at this late hour , but"
10995,I think that Mrs Mann has done an excellent job in this respect .
10996,"I would like to focus on two points , however ."
10997,"one is the issue of transparency , the other is the problem of a still pending trade"

11003,"by separating the interests of classification societies , shipowners and other stakeholders"
11004,"however , the disengagement of interests must not go so far as to force the players"

11009,there are some open questions that we would have liked to have answered by the Czech government
11010,"what is the Czech Government 's position on the question of whether , for example , there is"
11011,is there discrimination there ?
11012,it would be helpful if the Czech Government could give a response to this .
11013,"we hope that Bulgaria and Romania , which are not part of this round of enlargement , will"
11014,"in the agricultural sector , the situation remains worrying ."
11015,"in total , the biggest errors in the misuse of funds are found here ."
11016,"here , too , the Court points to the Member States ' laziness ."
11017,"in the important field of research and development , there have been losses due to mismanagement"
11018,"more than 50 % of expenditures are erroneous , and around a third"
11019,the same applies to the Structural Funds .
11020,"let us get to work , together with the Court of Auditors and together with the Commission ."
11021,this is an absolute necessity in the context of enlargement !
11022,the discussion on the financial problems of enlargement is no longer basically about the financial issues for
11023,"we must understand this , but we must also say that the enlargement process must not be taken"
11024,I also believe that we can agree that the path that was started in Berlin in 19
11025,"I am pleased that France and Germany in particular are currently making particular efforts , including in bilateral"
11026,I do not believe that the responsibility which Germany and France have in this matter is significantly
11027,I would be very pleased if we could complete this common line by the start of the Council
11028,"in the current fight against fraud or in the investigation of cases from previous years , the Commission"
11029,this also applies to information issues .
11030,if OLAF is asked to pass on information at a certain point in an investigation procedure that
11031,this applies to the Director of OLAF as well as to the Commission .
11032,I would like to point out once again that OLAF is independent in the field of investigations
11033,this means that OLAF is also independent in terms of reporting and that the question of whether
11034,packaging is now recycled all over Europe and no longer only in Central and Northern European countries
11035,there is no Member State that has not already achieved the minimum recycling targets for
11036,"the present proposal aims to set new targets for recycling and recovery , which are much higher"
11037,the timetable was and is very decisive in this matter .
11038,you all know that last December the introduction of the compulsory labelling system had to be
11039,"this postponement ends on 31 August , but in reality it ends at"
11040,I have to make a positive assessment and then a critical comment .
11041,"first of all , I would like to remind you that our group proposed that we should"
11042,"this has been adopted by the House , by the Commission , by the European Council in Nice"
11043,I know that there has been strong resistance to this .
11044,"but you have prevailed , and we are also grateful that a large majority of"
11045,"if you are right , if you are doing something good , Mr President-in-Office ,"
11046,as regards cofinancing - I know that this is a favourite topic for many - this
11047,"this must be discussed in this context , because it is a much broader issue , which"
11048,"Furthermore , there will certainly be some change or expansion in co-financing if"
11049,"in this context , I can only agree with all those who have referred to yesterday'"
11050,"however , when it comes to concrete implementation , we must also say where the money to strength"
11051,"there is only one source of money here , and that is the first pillar ."
11052,anyone who tries to ignore this reality does little to help us make real progress in
11053,but the auditors of the financial control must work independently .
11054,that is the decisive difference with what the Commission plans when it talks about decentralisation
11055,"the financial control officers must not be subordinated to the individual directors-general ,"
11056,"this is what we learned from the Leonardo case , where the internal auditors in the competen"
11057,"however , I do not think it is necessary , as proposed in Amendment No"
11058,these should already be covered by the scheme for less-favoured areas .
11059,that is why I do not think this amendment is necessary .
11060,"finally , I would like to thank the Commission , whose demands are almost identical"
11061,"what is now needed is a public debate with the governments , but also with the public ,"
11062,I thank all those who have contributed to this work .
11063,"of course , the European Parliament also has its difficulties here , but we have adopted a"
11064,"even though I do not agree with it 100 % , it is a compromise that"
11065,"unfortunately , the Council has shunned its responsibility and has not set out clear rules"
11066,"from Parliament 's point of view , the result before us today is a major success , which"
11067,"these include the elimination of the fragmented EU legislation in the field of water protection ,"
11068,compromise means - and this is a small chance to be part of a process if you
11069,I hear that amendments that were tabled at the last minute by the Chair of the
11070,"if you ask how a rapporteur cannot know this , that has to do with another reality of"
11071,but we will hear if we have made it .
11072,"discrimination against Christians , including by official authorities , must be a thing of the"
11073,India 's demand that Pakistan expose and extradite the men behind the attack on the Indian
11074,"however , the realization requires a lot of patience ."
11075,the Indian missile tests are an inadequate means of pressure and a counterproductive
11076,you will not be surprised to hear me refer in particular to OLAF and the fifteen
11077,"OLAF , which started its work on 1 July this year , replacing UCL"
11078,"I assume that this is the full concern of the Commission as well as of the other institutions ,"
11079,the state aid regulations that the Commission has presented at the last minute are also not
11080,we therefore agree with Mrs Thors ' report .
11081,"we are joining her in calling for the separation of content and infrastructure , the obligation"
11082,"we are calling for decoders to be part of the information infrastructure , for the interopera"
11083,we also very much welcome the fact that the Commission will approve mergers when open standards
11084,this is also to prevent the abuse of a dominant position .
11085,"however , if we enter into negotiations and can clear up this particular point , if we"
11086,we cannot stand by and say that we are waiting to see how things will develop .
11087,"I would like to recall that the Commission has offered to host , in the event of a"
11088,the feeding of meat and bone meal to omnivores will certainly remain prohibi
11089,as long as an open declaration of feedingstuffs has not been made compulsory
11090,I would like to mention the wording in Mr Olsson 's report :
11091,he also says “ in the near future . ”
11092,“ In the near future ” means for me that there may be a better way for us all
11093,I think we are in agreement here : we must bring to the political debate the fact that Asia
11094,I would like to conclude by referring once again to what Mr Brok said at the
11095,"relations between states are , of course , formally negotiated between governments ."
11096,but I say to the Heads of Government : civil servants and ministers need the support
11097,that is why this idea of the committee is …
11098,the debate here shows that everything we have in mind is not producing results because intergovern
11099,"we must draw the consequences of this , otherwise it will not work ."
11100,"we are arguing about legal bases , we are having some kind of foolish debates about"
11101,"the merger of producer groups and the formation of producer associations , as well as commercial c"
11102,this is where the market order rightly comes into play .
11103,"nevertheless , the farmers must also be seen , who market part of their production directly"
11104,"Mr President , I would like to reject Mr Dell 'Alba 's accusation that I"
11105,"this goes beyond a personal insult , and such verbal outbursts are not worthy of our"
11106,"I would ask you to ensure that Mr Dell 'Alba also follows democratic procedures ,"
11107,"Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Brok , I would like to start by saying that the report"
11108,I fully agree with the content of Mr Brok 's report and with the words he has
11109,"we must , we want to give money , and we want to give it quickly ."
11110,"we are happy to do so , but of course certain framework conditions must be met ."
11111,one element is certainly that we demand that the majority in Kosovo today treat the minority of
11112,I ask a second question :
11113,why does the US government not provide evidence until February 5 ?
11114,"if there is evidence that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction , the United"
11115,why not from February 5th ?
11116,now the Commission has changed its mind and has put forward a sensible proposal for a common approach to
11117,"it is supported by Mr Pirker 's report and supplemented in some specific areas ,"
11118,"unfortunately , a lot of valuable time has been lost because of Commissioner Verheugen"
11119,an example of the urgency : on the 456 kilometres long German-Poli
11120,Poland 's border with its non-European EU neighbours is more than 1
11121,it is completely illusory to believe that Poland alone will be able to secure this
11122,we will also be able to give ourselves new weight with the regional assemblies .
11123,this will also give a voice to others within ACP cooperation who have not had the opportunity
11124,but few are aware of what this ratification means .
11125,"the signature is given quickly , but the implementation is extremely difficult ."
11126,some have already pointed to this .
11127,"that is why I find it all the more regrettable that we - the European Parliament , which"
11128,it is indeed a major economic upheaval - and we are only being consulted !
11129,"I find this extremely regrettable , although I must say that I would have said '"
11130,"first , the ecological benefits , second , the job advantages ."
11131,"thirdly , I believe that everything that is invested in this area is neither a sub"
11132,we must recognize that .
11133,"fourthly , we should realise that in recent times fossil fuels have led to price"
11134,"Fifthly , there are more and more studies which show that the actual fossil energy sources are"
11135,"Sixthly , we are engaged in conflicts around the world – and we can see"
11136,"because of these different approaches , Parliament has been calling for a legal basis for European parties since"
11137,"ten years ago , the European Parliament achieved a breakthrough in Article 191"
11138,this article reads : ‘ Political parties at European level are important as a factor of
11139,they contribute to the formation of a European awareness and to the expression of the political will

11141,"in the conciliation negotiations , the committees which assist the Commission in implementing"
11142,"I would like to urge the Commission , which is no longer here , and I will do"
11143,"this article is also to the detriment of the consumer , because the legal uncertain"
11144,the so-called market value of GALILEO increases inversely proportionately to
11145,we must be able to apply the European principle of burden sharing in this area as well .
11146,the approach of the Member States to each other should not be painful in these circumstances
11147,we have to make nails with heads now !
11148,tomorrow it will be too late !
11149,"the biggest competitor , the USA , laughs at it and takes every delay in"
11150,"after all , we need seven to eight years for a market launch ."
11151,my appeal to my fellow Members is to jump over your national shadows and support
11152,you said at the end of the summit : ‘ The Nice Summit will go down in Europe
11153,"unfortunately , I have to tell you on behalf of our group that we cannot agree"
11154,I think that some of the good things that were said after 11 September have already been
11155,let us take the issue of external and internal security .
11156,let us take out the great speeches that our 15 Heads of Government made after
11157,then we will also recognize this as a low .
11158,I believe that we will only succeed in our endeavours if we create a vessel in
11159,that is why this convention is so important .
11160,"we must create an institutional reform in which Europe speaks with one voice , a voice that"
11161,"I do , however , find it remarkable , and this must be said quite clearly in"
11162,"I would like to ask you , Commissioner , how serious are you about improving administration at"
11163,"we do not need White Papers , we have an Ombudsman who receives complaints"
11164,"we only need to be willing to do so , not to postpone it again and commission reform"
11165,"if you do not lead and only seduce , and then , in addition , you have the"
11166,we have been supporting the Palestinian Authority on a large scale – with billions of euros –
11167,"but if you talk to the peace movement in Israel today , you will notice that Members of"
11168,"he is not stopping the violence , he is behind all this violence , which we also experience"
11169,in such a situation Sharon could only come to power .
11170,that is why we need a new connection for cooperation .
11171,we will make constructive proposals to the Finnish Presidency .
11172,I am pleased that a first meeting can take place at the beginning of September .
11173,my request to the Finnish Presidency is that we should hold the necessary discussions at the
11174,I believe that this will be the best way to ensure the success we want .
11175,"unfortunately , this situation is currently the case in many countries , including Austria , where a"
11176,"unfortunately , we are moving further and further away from the goal of becoming the most"
11177,"if new programmes are launched , they should also be implemented with the necessary consistency"
11178,"I think that the European Union should be a visible stimulus here , so that a chain reaction"
11179,"I agreed with the reasonable position of our rapporteur , which the Finance Ministers should"
11180,they in particular should know that any further delay in the recast of the money-lau
11181,"despite this , she was granted a penalty bail of 14.6 million"
11182,"yet , over all these years , the Commission has continued to do business with it without asking"
11183,"now the Italian financial police are investigating , and it is said that the company is involved in"
11184,"Mrs Stenzel 's report has nevertheless developed well , at least within the framework"
11185,all asylum seekers and refugees are to be explicitly included in the programmes
11186,"nevertheless , the Conservatives voted against it in committee ."
11187,I ask them : is it the aim of your policy to marginalise people ?
11188,what is the idea behind forbidding people from working when they want to work ?
11189,is this not in flagrant contradiction with the Employability Guideline ?
11190,I wanted to mention these points just once .
11191,I hope that we will take up this issue again next year and that we will then have a

11193,"firstly , Europe must establish clear priorities for its foreign and security policy interests and"
11194,"I have already said that the Commission is not planning an advertising campaign , but rather it is about"
11195,"the main focus will of course be on major issues such as peacekeeping , the expansion of"
11196,"we all know that even after the end of the military conflict , the problem of the peoples"
11197,we need a political dialogue after that .
11198,"we need political cooperation , because this conflict has not only arisen today ."
11199,it has arisen from the history of the Caucasian peoples in and against Russia and
11200,I believe that it would be in the European Parliament 's best interests if we could find
11201,"if the transport industry , whether it be in the tourism sector or elsewhere , is now"
11202,"some governments should consider whether they want to take the risk that , if they were to follow"
11203,we will be running an election campaign on Europe if the Council wants this topic .
11204,those who failed in Nice now want to be not only governments and legislators and
11205,"House , it is time for the parliaments of Europe to remember their very own mission , that"
11206,"it is time to oppose this Europe of imperial princes with another Europe , a European democracy and"
11207,this is the hour of parliaments .
11208,"that is the task of parliaments , and I am glad that this Parliament is undertaking to"
11209,"ladies and gentlemen , the debate on federal states and confederations of states is boring"
11210,"we can safely leave them to the next generation , but not the question of European democracy ."
11211,"that is the challenge , so that one day we can say : Vive la République d 'Europe"
11212,long live the European Republic !
11213,"Madam President , since we have just decided that the debate with the Commission and the Council will take"
11214,"if that were not the case , we too would be concerned about proceeding in such a"
11215,but now that the debate with the Council and the Commission on the international situation is scheduled for
11216,"however , it is an ethical and political question which now also requires an answer , and"
11217,what are the priorities of Parliament 's budget for 2001 ?
11218,I would like to outline this briefly in five points .
11219,"firstly , in the area of building policy - and this is a very important point - we"
11220,"firstly , this means - and we are creating the conditions for this - that we in"
11221,"on the other hand , however , this also means finding a solution for Strasbourg ,"
11222,as regards the proposal to study quality assurance and certification systems for what is called integrated
11223,"firstly , the speakers on this and the previous agenda item have a great goal ."
11224,we want to do everything possible to ensure that the Financial Services Action Plan can be adopted and
11225,"this directive is now part of the action plan for financial services and we hope that , un"
11226,"Madam President , I would just like to ask for your attention ."
11227,there are over 30 people up here .
11228,"but if someone reports on this page , it is almost never taken into account ."
11229,Mrs Flemming asked to speak at the very beginning .
11230,I just wanted to ask that we look at the right side of the House when we have request
11231,there has been no substantive change to the freedom of travel for third-country nationals
11232,"however , a new arrangement is in place for holders of national long-stay visas issued by"
11233,"contrary to the Commission 's proposal , I believe that such third-country nationals"
11234,"in so doing , he has trampled on Parliament 's budgetary rights ."
11235,"at the same time , it is forcing Parliament to choose between fighting for its rights and"
11236,"by acting in this way , the Council has broken the bond of loyal cooperation ."
11237,"not all the amendments , which may be well-intentioned in the interests"
11238,I think that this can be made clear by a number of amendments which were tabled
11239,"if we limit co-incineration , then we are not guaranteeing that we will bas"
11240,"above all , we want to save on fossil fuels ."
11241,"if we simply set the hurdles incorrectly , we will not achieve the right object"
11242,"thirdly , we , as the European Union , should be able to carry out rescue"
11243,these are three additional building blocks for a European Union security strategy .
11244,"certain sensitive areas , such as research , culture and documents containing business secrets , are"
11245,these exceptions ensure that the rights of third parties are not infringed by the Directive
11246,"in my view , in times of tight budgets , authorities should also have the right to"
11247,this also includes a reasonable profit margin .
11248,"let us not forget that many authorities have to finance themselves in part and that , of"
11249,"however , it is important that a proper balance is maintained ."
11250,"of course , the costs must not create excessive obstacles to the reuse of documents ,"
11251,"in view of the acute need for action , a new agility is now emerging"
11252,I very much welcome President Prodi 's recent reference to the need to find a solution for
11253,"in this context , I regret that the Commission 's information project on asthma , diabetes and"
11254,the Commission proposal was certainly misleading and raised the fear that advertising for prescription
11255,"however , the committee 's decision has lost the chance to improve information for patients ."
11256,I am sure that this mistake will have to be corrected in the coming years .
11257,"Europe has shown the yellow card since the interesting Commission report , Mr Liikanen , of"
11258,the continuation of Korean dumping practices must be punished by removal from the market .
11259,the appropriate response to this digital divide lies in integration with the other European instruments .
11260,primary and secondary schools are a very important target group here .
11261,"I therefore also believe that it is important to invest more in this group , so that we"
11262,"with the support of Parliament and the strong political will of the Council , we can complete this process"
11263,"we also agree with and support the Commission 's strategy , which Mr Verheugen has presente"
11264,we are firmly committed to the principle of merit for the conclusion of negotiations with
11265,"it doesn 't have to be 10 , but it can be 10 ."
11266,we are prepared for that .
11267,I also agree with the shift in the focus of the forthcoming reports from the trans
11268,this is indeed one of the most important points that we must clarify and maintain until the
11269,the Sharia law system in Nigeria is a complex and sensitive issue .
11270,"the situation is also very difficult from a constitutional point of view , because there are contradiction"
11271,"I would much rather see the European Union and , of course , all EU Member States acceding"
11272,"in other respects , the proposal is very welcome ."
11273,"it would have been better if it had been dealt with where it belongs , na"
11274,"not everything needs to be regulated at European level , otherwise the Treaty would have included"
11275,but that was not done .
11276,perhaps we should therefore consider whether it is right for us to vote in favour of
11277,"if we recognise the dangers of the free trade strategy , but still stick to it"
11278,it would lead to a complicated reimbursement system that would be bureaucratic and cost
11279,"it would open the door to further tax fraud , which we already know from VAT , and ,"
11280,why impose ever higher taxes on our businesses when the economic environment has been characterised for

11282,"in the negotiations that are beginning with China , we should focus on our own interests"
11283,"the most important elements are the reduction of high Chinese peak tariffs , the protection of"
11284,further market opening for the least developed countries – and we must consider this together – should in

11287,"when you give money , it is the privilege of the one who gives the money to define"
11288,I would nevertheless like to briefly outline this again today on behalf of my
11289,"not only is improving financial management , avoiding errors , avoiding delays ,"
11290,our differences of opinion relate essentially to the appropriate legal instruments .
11291,we should not exclude any instrument .
11292,we will need further harmonisation .
11293,we will certainly be able to apply the country of origin principle on the basis of harmonised
11294,"in some remaining areas , Article 50 of the EC Treaty will probably also continue"
11295,"I would like to say once again , on behalf of the other Members of my group"
11296,no !
11297,Mr Hager has made this very clear .
11298,these standards must be specified in the product description .
11299,"we want to avoid the situation where , at the end of the award procedure , when the tender"
11300,"that is the situation we want to avoid , because it would be contrary to the internal market"
11301,"that is why this is such an important point for us , and we would basically no longer"
11302,"I am only here as the representative of a small country , but I can assure you that"
11303,perhaps this is therefore one area in which the experience of the smaller countries in the
11304,"it is not so much about enormous financial resources and large inflated organizations , it is"
11305,and this is exactly where the EU has failed so far .
11306,"the 2003 budget , as has already been pointed out , is the last"
11307,"in February , we will already be discussing the adjustment steps together in the trialogue"
11308,"then , hopefully , there will be more clarity about the future of Northern Cyprus ."
11309,pre-accession aid for Bulgaria and Romania should then be increased and Turkey included in the
11310,this is what the Council decided in Copenhagen .
11311,the budget reflects the dynamics of European development .
11312,"I look forward to working together on these future issues , because I am sure that we will find"
11313,"secondly , I also have concerns about funding ."
11314,a total of EUR 1 730 000 000 of
11315,"the industry wants to use the 1.5 billion euro funds in the construction phase ,"
11316,that is 13 % .
11317,"from a business perspective , no company could afford to develop something like this if it only has"
11318,"they want to pay for this with public money , and I find this unacceptable ."
11319,the agreement between the European Union and Bangladesh is based on the strict respect for human rights and dem
11320,"if these rights are still being violated , we must exert political pressure and then we must"
11321,such important signals are known all over the Asian and also in other countries .
11322,we in the SAARC delegation can confirm this time and time again .
11323,"I myself worked on a specific case in the Committee on Legal Affairs , in which we have been"
11324,"that is , such processes are quite normal , they are not unusual in any way ."
11325,I can only strongly support your position on the issue of these immunities .
11326,"I do not think that the question of how to deal with immunities is , God know"
11327,"this is a matter of law , not politics ."
11328,"that is a very big difference that should be taken into account in the debate , and I am"
11329,the third point I would like to make concerns the implementation of this aid .
11330,"I do not envy the Commission for this task , because I know that in a few years"
11331,I hope that we will also give the Commission some room for manoeuvre in the use of
11332,"I know that this is a remark that one should not make today as a parliamentarian ,"
11333,"first of all , I must remind you that discrimination against the Roma is not only a"
11334,it is only that the numbers are not so striking because there are not so many of them
11335,I would also point out that the producers of citrus fruit have applied to the US court
11336,"on a legal or judicial level , this seems to be the best way at the moment ."
11337,"as regards the question of compensation , EU rules do not provide for direct compensation in"
11338,"however , the Commission will do its utmost to minimise the negative impact of the US measure"
11339,"with regard to the labelling of beef products , which covers all types of food preparations"
11340,as the person in charge of a delegation - I am the chairman of the delegation for
11341,at least four of the delegation staff are sitting in a small cage where I used
11342,"one talks to Dagestan , the second to Moscow , the third to Macedonia and the four"
11343,can you imagine that in a room ?
11344,I really ask you to do something for the staff !
11345,the current state of affairs is unbearable !
11346,"however , this also creates a new situation to which the industry and national legislators must adapt"
11347,"different regulations in the Member States , for example in the advertising sector , will result in"
11348,"this requires legislative changes and , in some cases , further harmonisation ."
11349,"in Germany , for example , the discount law and the additive regulation must probably be abolished"
11350,we Social Democrats believe that Mrs Dührkop Dührkop has also put forward a reason
11351,this will provide women 's organisations with certainty of planning and will save us from having
11352,"the 20 % co-financing for women 's organisations , with the exception"
11353,"finally , I would like to ask – and Mr Wynn has already addressed this very"
11354,"Mr President , Afghanistan is the country where the most and worst human rights violations occur ."
11355,the situation of women is particularly exemplary .
11356,"women cannot work , girls cannot go to school , women cannot move freely on the streets"
11357,not a single human rights organisation is working in Afghanistan !
11358,let us now work with them as equal partners .
11359,"in addition , we are giving the international community a positive signal , namely that it is"
11360,I would therefore ask that we not criticise the Austrian Commissioner 's behaviour
11361,"if we fail to build this equal partnership with America , it will also be contrary to"
11362,the American administration and President Bush should also recognise that the unity of Europe is a
11363,"thirdly , we regret that the proposals for further efforts in the border regions have not been"
11364,"I believe that the responsible governments in particular , but perhaps also the Commission , are"
11365,it is not currently ruled out that at least some of these regions will become the transit area
11366,"I therefore call on the Commission and the governments once again , apart from the real problem"
11367,another difference between the northern and southern agreements is that in the northern agreements the
11368,the situation is different with the southern agreements .
11369,here our possibilities are expressed directly in the number of fishing vessels or even in
11370,"in this respect , it is of course advisable to include in the agreements provisions"
11371,you can see that there are good reasons for treating the agreements between the North and
11372,the Commission must be expected to be proactive in this process and to do everything in its

11374,"I would like to leave no doubt , however , that we cannot promote catching up by"
11375,"we can help countries catch up , but not by sending their neighbours to the"
11376,I once said that manufacturers and we ourselves should imagine putting animal feed on a plate
11377,"Mr Bowis has just pointed out that we are dealing with negligence , but also"
11378,that 's right !
11379,negligence is the mildest word to use when animal feed is stored in a former
11380,I don ’ t know what motivates the people who do or even authorize such things .
11381,what about a waste disposal company producing glucose syrup at the same time ?
11382,is it not the case that we should perhaps become suspicious if an Irish company want
11383,"the waste he disposes of are washed-off coatings of contraceptive pills ,"
11384,a supplementary question : how do you behave towards far-left parties and what is your
11385,we have been dealing with these two Commission draft directives for a very long time now
11386,we had a public hearing on this a year ago .
11387,I think that after the intensive deliberations and a very lengthy vote in the Committee on
11388,but the left side of this House also bears a fair share of responsibility for the failure
11389,"the Commission already goes beyond the harmonisation of minimum standards , but the left side of"
11390,"under normal circumstances , in a case like this , we in the committee assume that this"
11391,"against this background , the vast majority of the Committee on Legal Affairs was of the opinion that i"
11392,"as regards biometric risks , it is clear that there is no European solution , particular"
11393,"this means that the entire capital market risk has been transferred to the insured , to"
11394,"you cannot say , as has been said here before , "" Give me your money , trust me"
11395,the restructuring processes in heavy industry and mining alone require increased accompanying measure
11396,it is therefore necessary to use all the means to help prevent this and to strengthen
11397,only then can a democratic development of social and labour legislation be guaranteed .
11398,"we talk a lot and often about the social dimension of Europe , but we deliberately for"
11399,"what I want to talk about here and today and what I have thought about three times , since"
11400,"when we were considering whether we should table amendments , we did not ."
11401,we will therefore not make any proposals in this area as far as the treatment of the
11402,"on the other hand , I would like to take the opportunity today , since no one else"
11403,I do not think it is acceptable for the European Union to offer Turkey accession but at
11404,I am surprised that we are not able to treat the question of Turkey in a different way
11405,"I know the reasons for this , but I would nevertheless like to use our Parliament"
11406,"there is another problem , namely the tendency to separate information from commentary more and more"
11407,the result is a kind of readership journalism where we are confronted in supposedly
11408,"the European Union must show this time that it is capable of taking a leading role , if not"
11409,it would be disastrous if the Europeans were to respond to the current political weak
11410,this is particularly an appeal to the Council to reach a united European position and to give the
11411,only a European Union with the power to negotiate can ensure that a better balance is achieve
11412,that is why we cannot talk about a new type of fisheries agreement at the moment .
11413,the outcome of the negotiations should nevertheless be supported and should form the
11414,"in return , the rapporteur expects Angola to comply with the Interinstitutional Agreement on"
11415,the Commission has the power to remove products eligible for export refunds from the organisations
11416,"for non-Annex I goods , this list is amended accordingly ."
11417,my question is : does the Commission now want a free pass for other products as well ?
11418,"I know that the countries have had very different views , also at the Council table ."
11419,is this really what we want for the dairy sector as a whole ?
11420,"that is why tomorrow I will vote , with the majority of this House , I hope ,"
11421,Mr Whitehead said that this is going to be very quick .
11422,"we do not need a Conciliation Committee , the Council and the Commission accept Parliament 's"
11423,"I also welcome cooperation with the countries of origin of migration , assistance for political and economic"
11424,"if we want to continue to have agriculture in Europe , we must also take care of our"
11425,"we are in favour of a multifunctional model of agriculture , in which farmers are"
11426,agricultural policy and rural policy as a whole live for and from its population .
11427,why did the international community create this International Criminal Court ?
11428,it was created because the Rome Statute for the Court states that the most serious crimes affect
11429,that is exactly the position of our group .
11430,"our values are human dignity , freedom , democracy and the rule of law , and no"
11431,"this dignity applies to everyone , to Jews , Muslims , Christians , Hindu"
11432,no one and no country has the right to escape punishment for crimes that concern
11433,"no one , no person and no state , is above the law ."
11434,"that is why we want an effective International Criminal Court that can act , and I am very please"
11435,we expect all the governments and parliaments of the EU Member States to do everything possible to
11436,we are calling on the candidate countries in particular not to enter into agreements until we have agree
11437,"I am very sorry that Romania , as an accession country , has concluded a treaty"
11438,this is not acting in solidarity with the European Union .
11439,the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs believes that the report 's delimitation of
11440,experience in the field of coordination of economic policies underlines the need for the Union to
11441,"it is not just a question of democratic control , which the European Parliament should exercise here ,"
11442,we support all the essential points of Mr Ribeiro e Castro 's report .
11443,I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his expert work .
11444,we particularly agree with the critical remarks – which he has just repeated orally –
11445,this makes our work a lot easier .
11446,there are therefore plenty of arguments against China hosting the Olympic Games .
11447,does anyone in this Chamber really believe that we can change the situation within seven years ?
11448,"the People 's Republic of China is free to apply again , and it will be a"
11449,only when China has become part of our international community of values can the IOC say yes
11450,"however , when we set up this system , this second pillar , we must not place any"
11451,they would no longer be able to cope with a further increase in non-wage costs
11452,the consequences would be catastrophic and would have a negative impact on the European
11453,"when the Community interest is established , the initial assumption that the imposition of measures"
11454,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very happy ."
11455,Mr Swoboda is making a mistake and I would ask that he be carefully noted
11456,"it is true that Parliament adopted something slightly contradictory yesterday , and I"
11457,we have adopted the Commission 's proposal on the transit system by a clear majority of
11458,the proposal states that the existing ceiling should be abolished .
11459,Parliament approved this by a clear majority .
11460,"this should not be a reason to , so to speak , simply thank the Macedonians ."
11461,"I also believe , as Mr Haarder said , that we owe them a debt of gra"
11462,but this thanks must be concrete .
11463,we must finally move on from this endlessly chaotic treatment of the name issue .
11464,"we must finally move on the financial resources for this country , which must benefit the whole country ,"
11465,"again , we are very satisfied with what the Commission is presenting here ."
11466,it will be about implementation .
11467,it will be a question of how seriously and with what transparency one ultimately wants
11468,"as Parliament , we are on the Commission 's side in this matter - and I would like"
11469,the CSU Group in the European People 's Party will not vote in favour of the
11470,I would like to see a broad debate on this subject in Parliament in future – particularly with
11471,"I also think that these proposals are right , because if we do not do so , then"
11472,to write in a directive that shareholders should be paid a fair price is about as
11473,then you have to write in what the appropriate price is and what the whole thing is
11474,"( de ) Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report ."
11475,we were in part in the same session .
11476,I was not in the Conference of Presidents either .
11477,our colleague Ingo Friedrich has gratefully represented us .
11478,we are in a position to decide whether we want a resolution .
11479,"our group believes that we should now have a very short text , not a final opinion ,"
11480,"we should then make a very detailed assessment at a later date , especially since we do"
11481,"this week , therefore , our group is of the opinion that we should have a short text"
11482,that is the position of our group .
11483,"firstly , the European Parliament proposed that the financial liability of classification societies should"
11484,the Council is in favour of a regulation which leaves the Member States free to set the
11485,"Mr President , Mrs Hulthén has already said a lot ."
11486,I don 't want to repeat everything .
11487,she has not emphasised that the common position before us is probably the maximum that is possible
11488,I know from the Austrian Presidency that it fought until the very end to achieve real
11489,"Mrs Hulthén , you know how much I have asked you to refrain from amend"
11490,I also told you that there will be many amendments which are not aimed at going
11491,"as an Austrian , I have no problem at all with moving faster and faster ."
11492,"but we must learn that other countries that have not reached as far as the Nordic countries ,"
11493,"I am sorry that you did not do so , because of course something has now begun to happen"
11494,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
11495,the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development rejects this request for urgent procedure from the Council .
11496,we believe that we have time to draw up a proper report .
11497,"we will not delay this report , because there are agreements between the groups that we will"
11498,"we do not want an urgent procedure because , as you know , we did not achieve codecision"
11499,"we would be willing to cooperate , because if we now approve the urgency procedure ,"
11500,"however , we believe that the Council is very divided on this issue and that the decisive"
11501,"Mr President , I welcome this report on risk capital , because I agree that it offers the opportunity"
11502,"there is agreement on many points , such as the provision of public and private venture capital"
11503,it is therefore particularly important that France now make rapid progress in transposing the
11504,"the new proposals from the Commission remain important and urgent in terms of competitiveness , lower prices"
11505,the Commission is therefore determined to continue to push forward with determination on this important dossier
11506,I was somewhat surprised by the extent to which the Committee on Transport and Tourism has
11507,"I do not think that is a good thing for a parliament , and I can only say to"
11508,the legislation is in force ;
11509,"everyone has said that here today , and the Commissioner has thankfully also made this very clear"
11510,"the last time I listened to you , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , I was very im"
11511,I very much welcome this and I also congratulate you on it .
11512,it should be noted that the rapporteur has taken into account port-specific circumstances
11513,"the vote in committee documented that there were no unified group opinions , but rather clear"
11514,"I support the removal of piloting , cargo handling and passenger services from the scope of"
11515,we need to have uniform tariffs to make the poor airport workers ' work easier .
11516,we want compensation to be paid at the gate if a passenger is denied board
11517,you really cannot ask the poor flight attendant to calculate thousands of fares and
11518,I therefore believe that our proposal is quite reasonable .
11519,the fact that television is the number one source of information is not only a special statement for view
11520,"access must be guaranteed , regardless of the form in which television is offered in the future"
11521,"however , if the future of television is digital , then access to this system is also an essential"
11522,the text I propose follows the original recommendation of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
11523,it strictly adheres to the Interinstitutional Agreement with the Commission and the Council and takes
11524,I ask you to support this initiative to amend the Rules of Procedure .
11525,this would help to clarify the situation as quickly as possible and I think that would even create
11526,"if the proposed amendment to the Rules of Procedure is implemented ,"
11527,"after reading the decision of the court , this is also clear :"
11528,"Parliament 's internal decision was not correct , but the regulation of Parliament and the Council of"
11529,the report shows that many of the progress made is not sustainable .
11530,"one is the lack of macroeconomic thinking , another is the implementation of structural reform"
11531,"it is clear that preventive measures have increased , such as the integration of long-"
11532,what is missing are qualified retraining and training opportunities for young unemployed people .
11533,what is also missing are part-time retirement models for older workers who are able and
11534,this is particularly true of agricultural policy .
11535,"because the European Union , through its aggressive export policy and its closure of markets"
11536,"the Council has insisted on committing a clear breach of law , despite the warning"
11537,"thirdly , the conciliation body ."
11538,"in the event of disputes , independent conciliation bodies must be set up , which"
11539,many problems can be solved internally before they become legal disputes .
11540,the majority of the Committee on Employment wants these offices to be set up in
11541,what Mr Trentin has said here does not correspond to the report presented by the Committee on
11542,"in school , I would say , Mr Trentin , you have missed the subject ."
11543,"there was no word at all on this in your draft report , and it was only the"
11544,today you have completely forgotten that again .
11545,I do not think it is possible to change the entire agenda because we have a great deal
11546,I would also like to recall the events in Belgrade last Thursday and suggest that we include
11547,this would be a very appropriate response to this problem .
11548,I would like to take this opportunity to say something else .
11549,the previous speaker said that Europe and the United States have the same vision .
11550,"unfortunately , this is not entirely true , because the fight against terror that the American"
11551,what is it all about ?
11552,"in the first round of the Trans-European Networks , the question of ports remained"
11553,the Commission promised at the time to make a proposal for ports in this regard .
11554,"it has done so and has also extended the proposal , not only to ports but also"
11555,"Parliament welcomed this Commission proposal in terms of the approach that seaports , inland"
11556,the Council has only partially adopted Parliament 's position and has not joined Parliament in
11557,"ladies and gentlemen , I would like to conclude by thanking you for the very"
11558,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased to see that the report"
11559,the ARGO programme aims to ensure that the EU 's external borders remain secure against
11560,the German closure regime on the Polish border serves as a model for EU border reinforcement
11561,"this strategy includes well-trained police officers , high-tech facilities and efficient"
11562,let me therefore briefly turn to the points that are important from Parliament 's point of
11563,I am grateful to the Commission for having taken a clear position on the classification in
11564,"as rapporteur for the Temporary Committee on Foot-and-Mouth Disease , I"
11565,I am pleased to hear Commissioner Fischler say to Mr Byrne that more money will
11566,and to the Council in general : a budget cuts following the lawnmower method is not
11567,"linear cuts are the wrong way forward , and we as Parliament also want full codecision"
11568,you can be sure that this would certainly ensure that decisions are taken in the best interest
11569,thank you for your attention .
11570,"Mr President , on behalf of my group , I would like to give the committee chairman our"
11571,it is not about restricting the right to demonstrate - absolutely not - nor is it
11572,"otherwise , we will no longer have foreign guests in our committees unless a minimum"
11573,we had both a president of a country and the foreign minister of Turkey in the committee when this
11574,I ask that this be taken very seriously so that we can continue to receive guests in
11575,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen ,"
11576,the 2004 budget has succeeded in quadraturing the circle .
11577,"it is the first budget for a Union of 25 Member States , an historic budget ."
11578,the 2004 budget clearly bears the profile of enlargement .
11579,it also clearly bears the profile of Europe 's increasing importance in the field of foreign
11580,"in addition , the establishment of a common area of freedom , security and justice is also"
11581,"at the same time , we have managed to bring spending to a historic low ."
11582,"the expenditure volume is EUR 99.7 billion , which corresponds to"
11583,"this result , the historic enlargement on the one hand and the limitation of expenditure"
11584,"we have a so-called employment reserve in the European Union , not of 1"
11585,"this so-called employment gap , the Commission says , costs the European Union 1"

11590,what steps will the Commission take to ensure that the valuable work of the networks and Info
11591,how will the Commission ensure that funding is made available for this work in the future ?
11592,when will the Commission take a decision on future funding ?
11593,the second proposal we will reject is that of setting inflation targets .
11594,"the European Central Bank , rightly , I believe , shortly after its establishment ,"
11595,that must not be changed now .
11596,"instead , the European Central Bank must be measured by its own standards , particularly"
11597,that is why we cannot agree with this second proposal .
11598,"as far as the Council is concerned , I believe that Helsinki had its ups and down"
11599,one highlight was undoubtedly the clear signal to the countries of the second group in Central
11600,I welcome this particularly in the case of Slovakia and the Baltic States .
11601,"I believe , Mr Prodi , that this is not just about an agency , but about whether"
11602,but unfortunately she doesn 't come .
11603,"we are thus at the provisional end of a very long journey , marked by a"
11604,I am extremely grateful that the European Parliament has always been absolutely clear in its

11606,"unfortunately , the project is still far from being realized ."
11607,"only at the end of last year , a subsidiary of the Austrian Brenner Railway Company"
11608,"therefore , more than 5 years after Essen , there is no concrete planning on the table"
11609,the people in the region do not understand this .
11610,they are the ones who have to live with the ever-growing traffic avalanche .
11611,"the current regulation , which limits the Union 's contribution to a maximum of 1"
11612,"however , this 1991 directive only had a minimum standard ."
11613,this minimum standard stipulated that drug offences had to be included in the list of pre-
11614,this has led to great differences in the implementation of the directive across Europe .
11615,"there have been Member States that have gone far beyond this minimum standard , and there have been Member"
11616,we already held a major hearing on this in the European Parliament 's Committee on Internal
11617,the result of this hearing was that this different standard of implementation is leading to major problems

11619,"this cultural programme can basically only be a small way of realizing this desire , that the"

11632,"but I would also add , because this is said occasionally , that I cannot imagine , and"
11633,"it has to be said , because it requires honesty ."
11634,this behaviour must be questioned – I say this very politely and carefully .
11635,"first , we know that American companies also bribe ."
11636,"in the corruption analysis available worldwide , they are in the middle of the bribery activities"
11637,"to tackle the current crisis , the Commission not only made EUR 238 million available"
11638,Europe must certainly not be characterised by a policy of indulgence and appeasement in
11639,but can this deny Europe the right to reject a light handed Bush-Rums
11640,we Europeans in particular are also fighting for democracy and the rule of law in the Arab

11642,we don 't have it !
11643,because doubt has been cast on our clear and unambiguous commitment to the UN and
11644,"do we not know that , in this particular region , even a UN resolution from 19"
11645,but we are rightly not prepared to wage wars !
11646,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very sorry that we have not been able"
11647,I think that the Stockholm Summit has set the wrong priorities .
11648,"too much social and educational policy – things that , according to the Treaties , have nothing"
11649,"in October 1998 , the Commission presented a report on the revenue side"
11650,many of the arguments in this report are shared by Parliament in its previous Haug I report
11651,"in particular , all reform considerations are about making the revenue side transparent , effective and simple"
11652,"transparency is no longer a given in the current system , with many detailed rules on"
11653,citizens can no longer see how much of their tax money is spent on the European Union
11654,"this lack of transparency is bad and as such , I believe , is already a reason"
11655,I find it regrettable that not all the actors in the macroeconomic dialogue are still aware
11656,we must be aware that we are still not independent of external risks and that we are not

11659,"I do not think that we should leave the judgment to the financial markets , but"
11660,"during eight years of apartheid in Kosovo , the Albanians did nothing to anyone ,"
11661,"but they have suffered terrible things , we must not forget that ."
11662,the mass graves that are being discovered every day bear witness to this .
11663,that is why I already think that living together will be very difficult .

11994,"Madam President , there are Amendments Nos 22 and 24 , which point"
11995,this is undeniably the case .
11996,"however , since we are dealing with a regulation which is directly linked to the pre-"
11997,"but as a compromise and to provide some security , I would suggest that the idea contained"
11998,"if the movers could agree to that , I would recommend to the House that we vote on"
11999,this could solve the problem in an elegant way .
12000,"Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to see that"
12001,"in connection with the last report on education , my colleague Roy Perry has already mentioned"
12002,"as an actress , this is nothing new to me ."
12003,I know that .
12004,it is sad that we cannot change and improve this .
12005,"I would like to thank the rapporteur , especially for the open dialogue he has had with us"
12006,"he was really there to record everything , and we discussed it ."
12007,"Mr President , it is estimated that 12 million people in the EU are victims"
12008,the dark figure is much higher .
12009,"there is exclusion and harassment , rumors are circulated , information is deliberate"
12010,"whether boss or employee , anyone can become a victim or perpetrator ."
12011,"bullying is still completely underestimated , so that hardly any effective instruments have been developed"
12012,it is a serious problem in working life .
12013,"Aggression and depression , sick leave , dismissals , and staff restructuring cause"
12014,"secondly , there were the UMTS licences , which have washed a lot of money"
12015,"Israel is showing its total contempt for the resolutions of the UN Security Council , for"
12016,"we are complicit in the massacres , in the crimes against humanity , in"
12017,there is no such thing !
12018,"it is important , however , that these models are introduced in all EU Member States in the"
12019,"only fair competition can ensure the acceptance of environmental management measures , whatever their nature ."
12020,"subsidies must be reviewed for their efficiency and , if necessary , modified or replace"
12021,what I know about it so far leads me to say that we are perhaps on the
12022,this does not mean that we can already know today whether everything that Turkey will tell us in its
12023,"in this respect , Mr Swoboda is absolutely right when he says that the ball is"
12024,"it is now really up to it to decide how quickly , at what pace and with what quality"
12025,I therefore emphasise what has been said by several speakers .
12026,but I would warn against bringing urban culture to the countryside with these programmes .
12027,and we should not create subsidies-dependent structures that depend on subsidies forever
12028,"to guarantee this sustainability – a slogan that has now become quite empty , but we"
12029,investments must have a visionary direction .
12030,young creative minds in the countryside must be bound .
12031,"when they all go away , there is not much going on there ."
12032,the following points should be made on Mr Jové Peres ' report :
12033,the report on the Commission 's proposal on the future common organisation of the market in olive oil
12034,the particular difficulty with foot-and-mouth disease is that this disease is highly infecti
12035,"therefore , immediate and appropriate action to combat the disease should it break out is"
12036,"I would like to make a somewhat critical remark here , namely that the report could have"
12037,the most important of these is the joint action adopted on 24 February 19
12038,"the Commission also intends to submit to the Council in 2000 , this year"
12039,"if this proposal is adopted , it would become part of the acquis communautaire , which"
12040,the second one actually precedes all that has been discussed here .
12041,I am very concerned about how the negotiating process can be accepted in the current political
12042,what is the Commission planning ?
12043,what is possible on the part of the European Union ?
12044,you have to worry a lot .
12045,the WTO is what it is .
12046,but what it still lacks in order to be accepted is transparency in practically all areas
12047,"what we are calling for in the report , in paragraphs 34 to 40"
12048,the only thing that is still lacking is the will to implement it .
12049,"as a result of the lack of transparency , we can read very dramatic , interest-"
12050,"the place where the WTO , or first the ministerial conference , will be held is certainly"
12051,what does the Commission think it can do to bring about change through a general information campaign ?
12052,are there any more concrete initiatives on your part to involve developing countries in the decision-
12053,"fourthly , the Commission is tasked with carrying out an evaluation of food a"
12054,"the results must of course be incorporated into future work , otherwise they would probably be point"
12055,"it is clear that the new Commission , even if not all its members are new , cannot be"
12056,"however , it does bear responsibility for how these legacy burdens are dealt with ,"
12057,"the Commission should also look closely at how it deals with staff members , for whose"
12058,our first objective must be to develop a transatlantic transport market through sound harmonised rules
12059,we must not again get into a dispute with the Americans over hushkitted airplane
12060,I would also like to reiterate that the European Union is prepared to take into account
12061,the Stability and Growth Pact is not a plaything and it must not be changed
12062,there is therefore no room for adaptation fatigue today .
12063,I would like to urge everyone to put an end to the fatigue that has begun .
12064,"further structural reforms are urgently needed , because we must move from one-off"
12065,"we must reduce taxes , but not at the expense of the Stability and Growth"
12066,we should also finally turn our words into action - and I am addressing this to the Council
12067,"let me mention another aspect , and I think that this must be the real operational content of"
12068,"Mr Vitorino , we thank you for presenting these proposals today ."
12069,"we really need to make Europol an instrument for combating crime , and we are calling on"
12070,"as we know , only one Member State has so far done so in a reasonably satisfactory"
12071,these measures were taken by the European Union and other Member States of the international community in accord
12072,"the list of individuals , groups and entities whose funds and economic resources are to be"
12073,these measures are binding on all UN members .
12074,the second point is the Court of Auditors ' failure to issue a DAS .
12075,this instrument is obviously not fully applicable in its current form .
12076,"if we do not have percentages on the error rate , it is very difficult for us to"
12077,"however , Macedonia must also make it clear that this Union is a Union of values ."
12078,"we do not always respect all of them , but these values include a high degree of tole"
12079,"I therefore believe that Macedonia must work together , across party political lines , to achieve this thre"
12080,there must be a joint fight against criminals .
12081,"I am deeply saddened by the death of four Macedonian soldiers , which I believe"
12082,there must therefore be a joint fight against criminals and instigators .
12083,"everyone is called upon to distance themselves , to condemn these acts and to ensure a climate"
12084,"so now we are not talking about the concrete figures , not about the input , but now"
12085,"what do we want , what goals do we want to achieve or support with the budget ?"
12086,I think it is good that the debate on a budgetary year begins with such a priorit
12087,"in connection with the setting of priorities for the next financial year , I note that there is"
12088,I believe that this is a good prerequisite for achieving a good result in the
12089,an important field of approach is the education sector .
12090,"women must learn to claim leadership and decision-making , among other things ."
12091,in all policy areas – at European and national level – there is no balance with a participation
12092,the quota is therefore an important instrument to move towards this goal .
12093,"however , it is not only a question of increasing the number of women , but also of en"
12094,"this afternoon , we will be deciding in the Commission on further new management systems , on"
12095,"a few weeks ago , we adopted a comprehensive package on improved personnel policy ."
12096,"in the summer of this year , I presented the report on the measures the Commission has"
12097,we can always criticise the fact that the administrative burden of INTERREG III is still
12098,"I would like to point out , however , that this is fatal in this particular case ."
12099,"we should aim for the simplest possible measures in the area of employment policy ,"
12100,"however , the necessary agreement with the Member States was never reached to transfer this special instrument ,"
12101,the special feature of this development fund is that it is financed directly by the Member States and
12102,I also share the view expressed in the amendment that producers should take more responsibilit
12103,"in principle , however , this is a matter for the Member States ."
12104,"therefore , we can only evaluate here , at the outset , what possibilities there"
12105,"in any case , this issue should be addressed in the context of the revision of veterinary"
12106,now to the 16 amendments .
12107,the first group of amendments concerns general issues .
12108,amendment No 1 refers to Regulation 1035 / 197
12109,we cannot amend the text of a repealed regulation ;
12110,"amendment No 2 is , however , acceptable in principle ."
12111,"I can also agree with Amendment No 3 , which points to the ecological importance"
12112,the ACT company has presented us with a fait accompli this week with the creation of a
12113,this is a clear crossing of ethical boundaries .
12114,"therefore , it is urgently necessary for us in the European Parliament to send a clear"
12115,it is therefore necessary to express our unequivocal opposition to reproductive and therapeutic
12116,this prohibition must apply to both private and public research .
12117,the reason for today 's question is our economic structure .
12118,the 18 million small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe create 7
12119,the issue of the cost of capital for these companies is therefore an essential basis for the competitive
12120,one last point that made me very skeptical is that when there was still the GDR and
12121,"so , the commercial assistance to refugees , which you are criminalising here , was highly"
12122,"I am therefore afraid that the whole issue is being exploited , that people are"
12123,"that is why they choose the refugee helpers , whether they are paid or not ."
12124,"they need our support in particular , so that more people can cross the border cheaper ."
12125,I am very pleased to hear this intermittent applause for Mr Mingasson
12126,thank you very much !
12127,the European Union must also deal very intensively with the refugee problem .
12128,hundreds of thousands are on the run again .
12129,we still have to deal with the refugee problem of the old conflicts .
12130,I would like to ask the Commission to make proposals as soon as possible on how to
12131,I think that being able to help in this area is a deeply European matter .
12132,scientific research in recent years has brought decisive findings in this area .
12133,"for this reason , we are also concerned about guaranteeing and promoting the continuation of"
12134,it is therefore good that we have a Code of Good Administrative Conduct and it is
12135,"however , we must then pay close attention to what this regulation will end up containing when it"
12136,in Germany there was once a regulation that said : from 80 cm of water depth
12137,"if you write this into a constitution , of course , then the comedians will make themselves out"
12138,"therefore , for good reason , this was not in the German constitution , but in a service"
12139,many Member States have expressed their feeling that they are being duped by this landlord-
12140,as strongly as our group welcomed the decision of the Cologne Summit and will actively
12141,"given the stagnant high level of unemployment , this pact is not worthy of"
12142,this is probably one of the reasons why so many citizens have stayed away from the European
12143,people in Europe do not understand when European employment policy degrades to a speech bubble .
12144,"finally , we must agree on binding and verifiable quantitative targets for economic growth"
12145,we are firmly committed to a social Europe and therefore we do not accept that social
12146,"and now the Council – supposedly the Council , I do not know , so far only"
12147,"for our part , the Commission has made several proposals during the negotiations to promote the"
12148,in every good agricultural textbook there are two classic pig cycles .
12149,"what we have seen in the last three years , albeit on a more drastic scale ,"
12150,the pig market is one of the few agricultural markets that has remained largely
12151,the pig farmers in my country are very happy about this .
12152,the establishment of a compensation fund would considerably accelerate concentration in European
12153,"you cannot create agencies where it may become difficult for you to do so , so that you"
12154,that doesn 't fit .
12155,that is why discussions are still necessary .
12156,I believe that we need an early warning system and that the Commission must have the right to act
12157,"this also includes a food framework directive worthy of its name , which must be legi"
12158,"secondly , I expect you to make a very clear statement this evening as to how long the"
12159,I believe that this is the only way we can really achieve a bit of clarity in this
12160,"Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the debate two weeks ago we already talked"
12161,today I would like to focus on a few comments on the text we have agreed with the
12162,what is it about in particular ?
12163,I have four keywords .
12164,the first is the Fléchard case .
12165,"Mrs Schreyer , you have just made it clear that the Commission would no longer act in"
12166,I note this with satisfaction .
12167,"however , I would like to remind you that , as good as it was that you all"
12168,it would have made a lot of things easier for us - both parties .
12169,"nevertheless , I must say that we are looking to the future , that we will build"
12170,"however , I welcome the rapporteur 's reference in Amendment 15 to the"
12171,"under the Portuguese Presidency , negotiations will be re-launched with six countries"
12172,we in the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats have always called for
12173,we would also like to ask you to give high priority on the European continent to the issues
12174,"as to the first question , I would like to say that there is no negotiating position"
12175,my own personal opinion is irrelevant in this context .
12176,"I cannot , in any case , present them to the European Parliament until the institutions themselves have"
12177,"Mr President , to many people Vietnam seems to be very far away ."
12178,"but here , for example , is Mr Mayer , a representative of Lower Bavaria"
12179,"one could say that Lower Bavaria borders Vietnam , because if you go from Lower"
12180,this shows how many waves of refugees have flowed from Vietnam to Central Europe and to
12181,"we are looking to Biarritz , and I can agree with most of what you have said ."
12182,"I would like to thank you very much , Mr Prodi , for the great speech you gave"
12183,"Parliament – and my group , in any case – will stand firmly on your side if you"
12184,"Mr President , I voted in favour of this resolution and I am glad that the per"
12185,"Commissioner , I am addressing you as the representative of the Commission here - and I am"
12186,I just do not understand the statements he has made in recent days .
12187,I quote :
12188,"the Commission has already presented an excellent Green Paper on fair transport prices , and one of the"
12189,I therefore believe it is absolutely necessary that the propagating seeds come from precis
12190,the Member States must therefore have the possibility of setting the selection criteria for seeds
12191,"I would also like to point out that it is not only the Alps , but above all"
12192,"secondly , why is there no strategic concept ?"
12193,the strategic concept is missing for a simple reason .
12194,"the policy in the European Union , insofar as it is pursued by the individual"
12195,a very complicated problem .
12196,that means that if we do not act quickly – and Mrs Cederschiöld is right on
12197,"for some , I would say , this may be an attractive prospect ."
12198,"if we are now close to concluding the signature directive at second reading , it will be"
12199,the objective of achieving a consistent and semi-complete European legal framework for
12200,"we still need the second readings of the e-commerce directive , the copyright directive and"
12201,the second thing I would simply like to propose is that we are talking about the European Research Area
12202,"we are enlarging the European Union , wonderful !"
12203,all these countries are already participating in the fifth research framework programme and will also participa
12204,I therefore propose that we should also involve the parliamentarians of these countries and the research
12205,I could imagine doing this in this way – in French we say assises de recherche – here
12206,the number of people without a job in Europe remains unbearably high .
12207,"this must be countered at every political level , local , regional , national , but also European"
12208,three years ago we started our employment initiative by helping small and medium-sized
12209,we all know that small and medium-sized enterprises provide the majority of all jobs

12213,"however , as in all years , progress has been slowed down by various votes and a"
12214,they don 't belong here .
12215,"I hope , however , and also expect that the good cooperation we have had with the Commission"
12216,"Mr President , a year after the Taliban regime in Afghanistan was overthrown , the dire situation"
12217,"the first five-member delegation of the European Parliament , initiated by the Socialist Group"
12218,"the health system is a disaster , every 20 minutes an Afghan woman dies during"
12219,this is the highest rate recorded worldwide .
12220,"many of those who are critical of the situation in Austria , not only through their amendments"
12221,"in Austria , nothing of this can be found ."
12222,the Council of Wise Men report has attested that Austria has achieved a standard above
12223,but they are looking for the speck in Austria 's eye and do not want to see
12224,instead of apologizing to the Austrians for the injustice suffered as a
12225,"if that is your understanding of a united Europe , that is what I am worried about ."
12226,"as a delegation , we have always insisted that this solution be found ."
12227,now we have finally found it !
12228,"not us , but the government under Prime Minister Georgievski and also the Albanian leader Xhaferi"
12229,this cooperation has led in an excellent way to a draft law which was adopted by
12230,most election observers conclude that the elections did not reflect the will of the people of Zimbabwe
12231,"however , we can state that , however disappointing the outcome of these elections may be"
12232,I was a member of that delegation as a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation
12233,it was also clear that there would be no retreat from the Monterrey outcome .
12234,one must also ask oneself in general whether it makes sense to hold such UN summits
12235,"but that is not the responsibility of the European Commission , of course , nor of Parliament ,"
12236,"when I think of the report by Mrs Terrón i Cusí , I find that we can"
12237,"if it has done so , it is only natural that some will ultimately have problems with its"
12238,"on the other hand , Mr Nassauer , I do not see why this report or the"
12239,why must the EC Treaty be regarded as a Bible ?
12240,"and why do we , the European politicians , who want Brussels to regulate competences"
12241,I think that in the long term we could look at the whole thing a little more generously
12242,what does not suit us today might be European policy in five years ' time .
12243,"for this reason , I can well imagine that this area could be treated much more generously"
12244,the experience of individual Member States which have already adopted far-reaching liberalisation regulations
12245,"Germany – I am sorry , gentlemen from the DB – is a model example of how you"
12246,"mass regional decommissioning , stations closing , cycle times increasing , repair shops"
12247,this has nothing to do with competition for service to the citizen !
12248,the processing premium to be paid to the first processor shall only be granted if proof of

12250,"of course , not only the premium for long fibres but also that for short fibres must"
12251,"Mr President , I am very pleased to hear Commissioner Lamy say that the next WTO"
12252,"my question to you , Commissioner , is : are you prepared to really go along with this"
12253,are you prepared to take these steps against the opposition in the WTO round for the sake
12254,"finally , I would like to say that amendments 1 to 5 in my"
12255,I recommend that we do not vote on it .
12256,"they are already included in the Turchi report and the amendments , so they are"
12257,I therefore recommend that we vote against them .
12258,"in fact , there was no vote on this in committee either ."
12259,this is really a mistake .
12260,"otherwise , I hope that this research fund will indeed become a second research pillar of"
12261,"this would correct this undemocratic error , which is indeed intolerable in our times"
12262,we must also strike a balance between the big and the small in this Intergovernmental Conference
12263,I would like to make it clear that the people see themselves represented in the European Parliament and
12264,"if the difference between the big and the small in the Council becomes too great , we must"
12265,what we are asking is for Parliament 's role to be strengthened and the principle of

12267,"it is our duty to follow the debates on Europe in the individual countries , not just in"
12268,I am always shocked that we have not yet succeeded in this debate in convincing the

12270,"it can only be a question of shaping it out of our values , out of our"
12271,"to this end , we must therefore succeed together in clearly improving the communication"
12272,I thank him for his proposals for greater transparency in explaining the decisions of

12275,three things are necessary .
12276,"firstly , we must provide rapid emergency aid ."
12277,this is an expression of European solidarity .
12278,"I emphasise "" fast "" and "" immediately "" ."
12279,it will not be enough for people in the affected regions to sit in their painstaking

12281,the close cooperation of various European universities enables an increase in quality and increases international
12282,the compromise on the financial framework of EUR 230 million is just a

12284,it is also made clear that these financial resources must be additional and not be redistributed from

12286,"I do , however , recognise that both groups contain some interesting aspects which the Commission will"
12287,I would point out that the consideration of increasing the funding for nuts is already the subject
12288,"I also hope to have the Commission 's support , at least on one of the three major"
12289,I think we should go one step further .
12290,"in the near future , we must seek to intensify dialogue with the collective management societies"
12291,"collective management societies are not just a kind of collection agency , they are very important partners"
12292,opinions on the resale right are not limited by political groups but by Member States .
12293,"I understand the different cultural traditions , but at the same time I ask this House to show"
12294,"it is not just about the individual national artists , national gallerists and national auction"
12295,"it is about the European art market and all its players , especially European visual artists ."
12296,I trust in the wisdom and foresight of this House .
12297,"we are right to criticise the human rights violations and discrimination in the candidate countries ,"
12298,thank you very much for this .
12299,the second point I would like to make on the Balkans can underline everything that has been
12300,"I would just ask that we also pay particular attention to the situation in Albania , where we are"
12301,I would like to say quite clearly that I cannot imagine that we are going to follow the
12302,"unfortunately , what has happened in recent weeks is not a contribution to stability ."
12303,"we want stability in the Balkans , we have done a lot , with great effort ,"
12304,I therefore ask both of you to follow developments in Albania with great attention and to make
12305,"with your communication on a sustainable development strategy , the Commission has set a new policy framework"
12306,the orientation towards a phasing out of aid to the tobacco sector is determined
12307,we also know that there is no direct link between tobacco production and the level of smoking

12314,what does this railway package contain ?

12317,"I could have imagined , Mr Jarzembowski and some others , that there would have"

12327,"secondly , the EU directive on the internal electricity market must be extended to include an"
12328,"thirdly , the EU 's funding policy should also be fundamentally changed , not to"
12329,the railways can only regain their share of the transport market if they are a real alternative
12330,"if the railways face this great challenge , they can only win , and we all with them"
12331,"of course , we must also think of the thousands of private individuals whose homes"
12332,"by bringing together the existing legislation on employment aid in a single text ,"
12333,the dignity of every human being should not only be respected on paper and in the Basic
12334,a little more respect and fairness and less selfishness would probably save us a discussion about

12338,"it is not a radical innovation , but it is a profound innovation and a continuation of"
12339,"I would also like to thank Mr Izquierdo Collado , who , as a Spaniard"
12340,"we have Brussels II , we have made legislation for the European Union , and we have"
12341,"at the same time , the European Commission , without informing Parliament , allowed this very convention to"
12342,this raises an institutional question of the relationship between the conventions and the European legislative
12343,"in conclusion , we are in favour of this exception because we believe that this convention is extreme"
12344,"we will , however , raise this issue again in the Committee on Legal Affairs , because it"
12345,that would not be a sensible thing either .
12346,I would like to recall how we took a very ambitious approach to the Euro
12347,I believe that the compromise package that I am able to present to you here goes in the
12348,"in this respect , what we have on the table today is not a ' chainsaw massacre"
12349,"you see , the Packaging Directive has already led to extremely different implementation and cost"
12350,the maximum quota is therefore also intended to help ensure that the four-speed Europe in
12351,"since 1994 , only Austria , Germany , Belgium , the Netherlands and Denmark have"
12352,"thirdly , will you continue the euro information campaign with the Member States at least during the first"
12353,looking back on two years as Budget Commissioner and two years of budgetary consultations with the
12354,the most important agreement is the one with the United States .
12355,"we want to have a transatlantic air transport market with reasonable access rules , with reason"
12356,"I believe that this is economically beneficial for all our airlines , whether it be Air France"
12357,I therefore hope that we will make rapid progress here .
12358,this is not only due to the fact that structural reforms are still lacking .
12359,"of course , structural reforms are important for us ."
12360,but who has ever calculated the economic weight of these structural reforms so that we know
12361,"in this respect , we cannot do without the organization of growth ."
12362,"if the European Parliament 's demands are not met in the foreseeable future , there"
12363,"I very much hope , Mrs Wallström , that the European Commission shares this position ."
12364,"I particularly welcome the clarifications and extensions made by Mr Santini , for example"
12365,"in addition , there are a number of other points that provide very concrete assistance to the victims"
12366,"both reports help us , as citizens of the Union , to have a positive experience of life"
12367,I congratulate both rapporteurs on these excellent reports .
12368,thank you for your feedback !
12369,"we need many new , safe , good ships for these double-hull tankers ."
12370,I would like to see these ships built in European shipyards under fair competitive conditions .
12371,"the Commission recently presented its report , which documents that Korea is practicing very unfair du"
12372,"I therefore sincerely ask you , Commissioner , and your colleague , Mr Monti"
12373,there is uncertainty in the European shipyards .
12374,please help ensure that the Commission sends a clear signal in this regard .
12375,we are building new credibility on the one hand and we should not waste it on the
12376,the idea of active ageing is basically accepted .
12377,"in this context , we can recall the 2000 employment guidelines ,"
12378,I would also like to refer to the contribution of the Committee on Women 's Rights to
12379,he points to the countless women who receive widow ’ s pensions and have to live
12380,we must counteract the tendency to reduce these widows ' pensions .
12381,this is a very important concern of the report .
12382,"nevertheless , there is still a great deal to be done ."
12383,"I do not believe , as Mrs Hautala did , that the citizens can be won over for"
12384,what works excellently in the canton of Appenzell - a small democratic entity -
12385,"this would lead to a society of hysteria of demagogues in television stations , who"
12386,what we need is decentralisation and the rule of law .
12387,"we must ensure that the good things , which are really outstanding , are then transferred to"
12388,I hope that the Council and the Commission will respond quickly to our proposals so that the programme

12390,framework legislation and the use of other regulatory mechanisms can only be a good
12391,these guarantees must be such that the power to define the framework legislation is not left
12392,"it is not only a privilege of Parliament to insist on this , it is an obligation"
12393,one aspect that should also be addressed here is the situation of third-country nationals
12394,I think that even though we are today recalling the objectives of the internal market
12395,"we should not only be concerned about the variety of goods and services offered , but also"
12396,"as regards the amendments to the five Council drafts , the Commission notes that Parliament"
12397,although some of these amendments seem to me to be quite useful from an editorial or technical

12399,"secondly , the common position also makes little real progress in terms of civil-military c"
12400,"I know this is a highly sensitive issue , but we cannot wait for decades to see"
12401,the committee has made it unequivocally clear in its report that this situation must not occur
12402,that means that all Members of this House have access to all confidential information .
12403,"I have just as little sympathy for Islamists as many others in this House , especially when"
12404,"only , this must be regulated on a legal basis !"
12405,it is not possible to remove all those Islamists from office suddenly by an emergency decree
12406,is it really a problem ?
12407,then it is a problem that must be dealt with in Parliament .
12408,"on this basis , I would also ask - and we do not ignore America 's great"
12409,this will be the case now .
12410,I now turn to the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters .
12411,the establishment of a judicial network in criminal matters was decided in 1998
12412,this operates through national contact points that provide advice to local authorities .
12413,"after initial difficulties , which were mainly of a technical and linguistic nature , the network is"
12414,"Mr President , I would like to ask the Commission how it intends to guarantee the democratic"

12417,I would like to thank my colleague very much for her excellent work and I assume that
12418,"nevertheless , a very important step is being taken here today and a signal is being sent"
12419,those who look at Russia from the outside and then get some direct impressions of the country
12420,the current discussion about Russian state symbols shows us that there are several realities in Russia .
12421,"we have the state flag of Peter the Great next to the Red flag for the army , there"
12422,"perhaps these opposite symbols are not so far apart , since each of them represents"
12423,"I would also like to emphasise that the directive , however pleasing it may be"
12424,"I have the increasing impression that directives on the protection of workers are beautiful on paper , but"
12425,"this may be related to economic development , but it is especially in difficult times that we must pay"
12426,"I say this with a particular regard to the candidate countries , because we also have to set a"
12427,I can assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the role played by the fight against fraud
12428,the strict framework conditions for the establishment of the EU service card – and here I
12429,why do I think the directive is so necessary ?
12430,"there are three reasons : the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU ,"
12431,I therefore welcome the strict framework on the one hand and appeal on the other hand for
12432,"the framework agreement , which was drawn up with a hot needle and presented to"
12433,it cannot therefore stand in this way .
12434,it must be adapted to our Rules of Procedure and not the other way around
12435,I therefore ask that Mr Bourlanges 's amendment be rejected and that
12436,it is equally important that no Mediterranean country is excluded .
12437,"what is not mentioned in the Barcelona paper is Libya , the country that lies pretty much in"

12451,"I think that after the first flop that the Commission and you have produced here , are you"
12452,what then - a general concept or regulation in each individual proposal ?
12453,there is no doubt that the Council will throw this proposal in the trash as well

12455,the report fails to take account of the necessary prerequisites for effective prevention

12457,"with this report , we are sending a misleading signal not only to the EU Member"
12458,I have received many letters and calls - as you all have - from concerned organisations

12460,this is one reason why this report not only worries people in the countries of Central and Eastern
12461,"it makes fundamental demands on the governments of the candidate countries , while they are not involved"

12472,the people of Serbia have expressed their will in democratic elections and they can clearly see
12473,that is why we must support the Serbs in their desire for freedom .
12474,"if the Helsinki conclusions on the solution of the Cyprus question are amended , as some speaker"
12475,that is exactly what we changed last year with the broad support of the European Parliament .
12476,we have said in the past that it is not a precondition and that all we can

12478,"therefore , you cannot ask Turkey for anything more than serious , constructive and credible efforts"
12479,"in conclusion , we thank the Commissioners and in particular Mr Costa Neves for their constructive"

12489,we are talking about the opportunities of a new European labour market and mobility for the young generation
12490,we are talking about the fact that we already have shortages in the skilled labour markets

12492,element No 1 is OLAF as an investigative unit that quickly and efficiently investiga
12493,the legal prerequisites for this have been created .
12494,we have done what we could together with the Council .

12503,I had asked – and I have now done so again – that a study be drawn up

12536,what the report wants is exactly the opposite .

12549,"I cannot understand at all why a commissioner who is now supposed to control this data ,"
12550,I can 't see why that should be the case .
12551,a judge at the Court of Justice has a much higher and more significant position .
12552,"judges are , after all , the guardians of our treaties ."
12553,so why should we pay a data protection officer the same as a judge at the European Court of
12554,I think that over the years our standards of value have shifted a little and that they
12555,that is why we should consider bringing the Ombudsman back to the right level of pay

12566,I would like to confirm once again the Commission 's position on the amendments .
12567,it is in exact line with the statements made by Mr Bolkestein yesterday .
12568,"the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 4 , 8 , 10,"
12569,"on the other hand , the Commission is prepared to accept Amendments Nos 1,"
12570,amendments Nos 6 and 7 can be accepted in part .
12571,"amendment No 9 can be accepted as a declaration , but not as an article"

12573,"similarly to other Europol analysis systems , when it comes to organised crime , we"
12574,it would be desirable - and this would be an overall objective in order to become
12575,certain synergy effects could undoubtedly be achieved here .
12576,"I thank the rapporteur , Mr Lehne , for the cooperation we have had ."
12577,East Timor has taken the first step towards independence and the establishment of its own state
12578,this makes it all the more necessary for the international community and the European Union to continue to

12587,I can tell you that the Council has obviously accepted our request to introduce this as of
12588,this is a small victory for the European Parliament in terms of time .
12589,it did not take this decision in the framework of the codecision procedure .
12590,that would have meant that he would have had to adopt all the other amendments on
12591,then everything would have been adopted by us in the codecision procedure .
12592,"instead , it decided , in the context of the old Regulation 820 / 9"

12594,"however , in fact , it is an approach to the European Parliament ."
12595,"finally , we must not overlook the extent to which the BRCA patents are"

12609,the amendments were unanimously adopted in committee .
12610,"it is no secret that Latin America 's share of world trade , and therefore Argentina'"
12611,this is also due to the fact that there is no investment in the future .
12612,"capital is fleeing , but people who were trained in the countries themselves , in Europe"
12613,"in this respect , this cooperation with Europe – I repeat – is an encouragement to"

12620,"in conclusion , I would like to thank you very much for the many compliments we have"
12621,but I see it as a call for us to assume our responsibility in future !

12625,"however , we expect - and I believe quite rightly - that national governments at least provide"
12626,whether a government official loves these proposals or not is a second matter .
12627,"what one can expect , however , is that no false information is put into the world !"
12628,"unfortunately , this requirement is not always met ."
12629,I would therefore say that this is a common concern .
12630,"I can only ask you to help , in your capacity as Members of this House , to"
12631,"I will continue to do everything in my power to pass on this information directly from Brussels ,"
12632,I cannot confirm the accuracy of the BBC television report .
12633,the fact that something has been broadcast on BBC does not automatically mean that it is correct .
12634,I do not mean that it is wrong either .
12635,we just can 't confirm it .

12644,that is why it is all the more important that the Commission now finally takes this step in the

12646,the Commission is called upon to carry out a review of compliance with the provisions

12655,I therefore have no choice but to give my full support to the proposal of the Committee on

12657,"the precautionary principle applies here , and as long as we cannot rule out the possibilit"
12658,I wonder what the message of this Intergovernmental Conference is to our citizens .
12659,"I believe that citizens must know that this Union is becoming more democratic , more transparent and"
12660,this means that we must also close the democratic deficit that exists .
12661,Parliament must have codecision in all cases where the Council decides by majority .
12662,we also want to improve the possibilities of monitoring the Commission .
12663,we have made proposals that the President of the Commission should be able to put the question of

12665,"today we are having secret negotiations on countless dossiers , and I wonder how we"
12666,"secondly , as far as financial support is concerned , we should distinguish between everyone and"
12667,there you will probably be able to differentiate .
12668,"I hope that the Council will also take the leap and make these statements , because it"
12669,"this will result in equality and parity in the pre-accession strategy , and at"
12670,"as it has been handled so far , it cannot be reconciled with a normal budget"
12671,I think it is important that the European Parliament has nevertheless contributed positively for this
12672,"it would therefore be important for the Presidency of the Council , in the context of the"

12680,"Bhutan and Nepal are not neighbours , but they are close in mind ."
12681,"both are kingdoms , both parliamentary with a young tradition , one Buddhist , the other Hindu"
12682,both know that the ongoing conflict is paralyzing their national and economic progress .
12683,Bhutan accuses Nepal of being incapable of acting due to constant changes of government
12684,that has changed .
12685,Nepal accuses Bhutan of not being ready for effective solutions .
12686,hopefully that will change .
12687,"secondly , the euro is a new currency ."
12688,a new currency must earn the trust that others already have .
12689,"thirdly , we had a not insignificant interest rate gap with the United States of"
12690,"when you see , for example , that the fruit and vegetable sector is supported at"
12691,"unfortunately , the coating is set correctly ."
12692,it is indeed 3.8 % .
12693,"this is a disadvantage which benefits another sector of agriculture , namely arable crops"
12694,international trade agreements are partly at the expense of this fruit and vegetable sector and

12696,we are losing revenue .
12697,"in other words , what do we need to do to improve revenue from the tax side ?"
12698,"we must prevent even more companies from going bankrupt , because bankruptcies threaten to cause"
12699,this trend could intensify if we do not prepare for the introduction of Basel II in time .

12705,the European Parliament report makes a very clear distinction between these two areas .

12708,improvements in safety on board are necessary .
12709,"I agree with this , but it must not lead to an increase in fishing effort ."
12710,"the Greens , on the other hand , have a clear position ."
12711,they are rejecting all attempts to preserve the acquis and to make exceptions .
12712,"solidarity between regions must remain the top priority , but at the same time there must not"

12720,"Mr Nisticò , of course , even after a sales ban , the existing products should"
12721,only products that have been tested on animals after this deadline will no longer be sold .
12722,I am very pleased with the announcement that the Convention will be allowed to set its own

12739,what do we mean by a prospectus ?
12740,a prospectus is a document published when shares or bonds are issued and contains information

12742,"the aim is to introduce a single passport for prospectuses , approved by the authorities"
12743,"instead of the 15 separate authorisations required despite two relevant directives ,"
12744,the obligation to respect rest breaks and the definition of maximum and night working hours contribute
12745,we therefore voted in favour of adopting the directive .
12746,"however , the temporary exclusion of self-employed drivers from the scope of the"
12747,that is a problem .
12748,this is likely to encourage the development of new forms of false self-employment .

12767,"Mr President , I would like to point out that we , the Group of the European People'"
12768,everyone in this Europe must find his place in this society .
12769,"everyone is looking , perhaps from cradle to grave , to use this quote again ."
12770,"everyone wants to find himself in this European society , in this mirror of European society ,"
12771,"if we do not help to make this possible , we will not be able to tackle conflict"

12776,the summit here in Brussels next Friday should be a signal in many respects .
12777,it should be a signal to our American friends that the diabolical attacks in Washington and

12779,"both social cohesion and belonging to European citizenship require a European cultural policy ,"
12780,the European construction has long since left behind its economic and technical orientation .

12792,"you gave an important speech to the German Bundestag in Berlin , you gave an important speech here"
12793,the debates on the future of Europe and on the Intergovernmental Conference go hand in
12794,"we must ask ourselves : what is the Europe we want , what is the method ?"
12795,you thankfully recalled Pierre Pflimlin and Robert Schuman .
12796,we are proud that both were Christian Democrats .
12797,we must therefore make every effort to provide the citizens of the current and future Member States with
12798,no partner should be overburdened in the accession process .
12799,"therefore , it is absolutely necessary to conduct negotiations in a flexible and result"

12801,"instead , officials who point out misconduct and are not willing to cover it up are"
12802,"I believe that the Commission , and the Commissioner in particular , is not doing its job !"

12804,"I am saying this so clearly because I am a convinced European , because I want this"
12805,allow me to make one final point .
12806,"information work , the information campaign , will be of great importance both in the Member States and in"
12807,I hope that it will be better organised in the accession countries than it is at present
12808,"Commissioner Verheugen , perhaps we could have a discussion about how we can change this ."
12809,"we are talking about the Lithuanians , Latvians and Estonians , who were not asked whether"
12810,"a word now on Turkey , because this issue will also play a role next year ."
12811,I fully agree with what Mr Brok said - and I could have said it myself - that
12812,that is exactly what we want to achieve with the pre-accession process .
12813,I must say that I do not see why a successful strategy should be abandoned .
12814,"what we did in Helsinki really set the process of change in Turkey in motion , more than"
12815,"on the issue of the date , the Commission has made its preference clear ."
12816,the Commission maintains that all candidates should be treated equally and that therefore

12818,"well , Mr Van Orden , minorities are not just 2 or 3 % of a"
12819,"it is partly a very large minority , if I think of the Kurdish population ."
12820,"but there are of course other minorities , Greek , Armenian , Syrian , which must also"
12821,I would like to remind you that until recently Turkey denied that there were any minorit

12823,"and it is precisely through the persistence of this Parliament , together with the Commission , but"
12824,"if we had always been as soft in our demands as Mr Van Orden is , we would"
12825,and I know that Commissioner Verheugen has often been criticised in Turkey for his harsh
12826,only in this way can we help Turkey to follow the right path of change and progress in reform
12827,my question to the Danish Presidency is therefore : the Commission is acting differently in

12829,"do you see a chance that , under the Danish Presidency , a new European initiative can"
12830,"Madam President , if we were to do that here , we would not need to introduce the oral"
12831,that is why it would be easier to do it here .
12832,"fourthly , the additional negative effects on the economic situation caused by increased spending on"
12833,it takes a certain degree of optimism not to fall into the sometimes stereotypical criticism
12834,"Mr President , perhaps I can be helpful ."
12835,"the rapporteur has stated that she agrees with your proposal , that is , with the"
12836,I will recap : the President has said that we will vote at 5.30
12837,I would ask that we proceed in this way .
12838,Sarah Ludford has stated that she agrees with this .
12839,"so , at 5.30 p.m. , the vote on the postpone"
12840,I am asking for that .
12841,if Mr Berlusconi thinks that we should strengthen Europe by being more American than
12842,"an institution like the European Parliament cannot guarantee security itself , cannot be responsible for it , it"
12843,we will do so .
12844,"in this sense , I urge you to support Mr Swoboda ’ s report or ,"

12849,that is – I ’ m saying it very slowly – 0.0002
12850,I fear that this policy creates the crises it wants to overcome .
12851,"therefore , we can only say a clear no !"
12852,"firstly , I should like to thank the Commission , and in particular Vice-President Palacio ,"
12853,we are very grateful for this .
12854,"however , in the codecision procedure , we as Parliament will take the view that the positions"
12855,the Council only wants to take small steps .

12867,you have read it and I would be glad if you could agree point by point .

12884,"we work in several categories , not least because we have ten different material streams that have"
12885,"but let me first say something about the points on which the committee has followed me , for example"
12886,my children would ask me why I am going to Brussels if I do not have my results
12887,"we have said that – once the parliamentary process is over – the Member States must , after"
12888,companies should work according to this directive 30 months later .
12889,"I believe that this is a right point , and I am sure that the Commission will follow up"
12890,I hope that the Commission will be guided by the spirit of this directive in order to

12907,these are very important objectives that require a joint effort to achieve them .
12908,"this is , above all , a joint effort of the Commission and Member States , since 8"
12909,they are responsible for primary control .
12910,we have now also discussed these tasks of the Member States in detail in the Ecofin
12911,I cannot yet say that I am completely satisfied with the Member States ' responses to
12912,we have two problems here :
12913,"on the one hand , our committee 's resources are not in a position to follow and influence"
12914,"on the other hand , we have many Members from other countries – mainly from developing"
12915,"I would like to mention just two points at this point , which will be a concrete test of"

12918,this concerns above all the reference values with which energy savings are to be demonstrated

12945,"therefore , I consider this step to be absolutely right and crucial , however small it may"
12946,it is also beneficial that this is happening in a country where there is no current crisis
12947,I would like to say here once again that the prerequisite for the opening and conclusion
12948,we certainly need partners for this policy .
12949,"the USA is a privileged partner , that is clear , but we also need to strengthen"

12953,we can achieve financial savings and do not have to eliminate ecological damage .
12954,"for these reasons too , we need a strategy to develop more environmentally friendly products and services"
12955,"the report before us , supplemented by the amendments adopted in committee , provides a"
12956,"however , the Commission proposal was not very helpful to the discussion process in committee ."
12957,"the statements made in this paper were vague , there were no structures for further action"
12958,I believe that no entrepreneur or consumer can be won over by a plethora of proposal

13023,the Council has finally turned to imposing sanctions on Russia .
13024,"but given the long time the war in the Caucasus has already been raging , this decision"

13079,I am saying this very clearly in connection with the two reports we are discussing here
13080,we want food safety and therefore safe production from the beginning of the food chain to the end
13081,this is something that has always been unanimously supported in this House .
13082,"we have managed to work together in this House , across all political groups , in a spirit"
13083,we also know that small and medium-sized enterprises have difficulties in accessing

13085,we therefore also ask the Commission not only to accompany the Basel process in the spirit of

13087,there have been times when this cooperation was not sufficiently developed .
13088,"I would just like to highlight one key point in the content of the directive , which has"
13089,it is about the question of which regulations a web trader must adhere to when doing
13090,the directive provides for the application of the so-called country of origin principle .

13139,I hope that we do not have to ride our bikes in Brussels .
13140,I think that 's a little too dangerous .
13141,I consider the initiative of the city of Strasbourg after the change in mayoral office
13142,so we are now allowed to take the tram .
13143,maybe we can take the metro in Brussels .
13144,then we would have come a step further .
13145,"but as I said , I think bicycles are too dangerous ."
13146,I hope that we will find sensible solutions here .
13147,the control or reduction of these pollutants does not affect the total pollutant potential
13148,"this then leads to a severe local pollution and damages human health , especially"
13149,we should always remember that .

13169,"in Austria , and in my region in particular , an EU-funded project has been running"
13170,many women were able to get a permanent job through this activity .

13195,"in this area , much more could be done to eliminate youth unemployment and invest in Europe ’"
13196,but that is precisely why it is also right that the Commission is proposing in a paper
13197,"we must now seize the opportunity to strengthen a sustainable agricultural policy , bring"
13198,I count on your support !
13199,"as for the vote at first reading , we will certainly get it through without difficulty ."
13200,"I would like the Council to make as much haste as we have , to adopt its common"
13201,then we are prepared - and I promise this on behalf of my fellow Members
13202,"I believe , however , that the Council still has to take a few steps towards us in this"
13203,"if the Commission could help him on this path , I would be very grateful ."
13204,"thank you again , Mrs Reding , for this proposal ."
13205,we are grateful that she finally came !
13206,"however , my group and I have serious reservations about the Ludford report because , under the"
13207,I will also tell you what points we do not accept and why .
13208,these are the points that fall outside the 1997 / 98 reporting period
13209,"and if Sarah Ludford thought that the report would deal with 2000,"

13213,the Council and the Commission must put pressure on Russia to ensure that a general piloting obligation

13216,"in doing so , the Commission and the Member States have endeavoured to formulate ,"
13217,it was also stated that the Council will continue to respond appropriately to both positive
13218,one last point : I agree with what has been said about OLAF .
13219,a large part of my group will support this .
13220,"now to the first proposal , the inclusion of flax and hemp in the crop"
13221,"I am prepared to accept Amendment No 2 , which concerns the formulation"
13222,the idea of doubling the aid per hectare if proof is provided that the stra

13224,"in doing so , we would in fact create new incentives for a new hunt for premiums"
13225,"similarly , we must place increasing emphasis on the question of protecting the Union"
13226,"here too , there have been and there are proposals that would mean that at some point we"
13227,"it is not due to the candidate countries , as we have seen in the case of Slovakia ,"

13230,"firstly , SAPARD as a concrete example ."
13231,funds are flowing in a completely inadequate way here .

13235,many positions remain vacant for long periods of time without at least temporarily having

13245,"anyone who really wants to help them get out of this situation , anybody who really"

13257,we have plenty of opportunities to take advantage of this opportunity in the next three months .

13260,"as you can see , this is supported by the vast majority of the House ."

13262,you have said many good things about the euro .
13263,"I agree with you , but have the courage to strengthen the euro in Europe by"
13264,I would like to focus in particular on two aspects of the Commission 's proposal .
13265,"firstly , the reorientation of content ."
13266,following the Lisbon Summit proposal to support the transition to a knowledge-based economy and society in
13267,"this approach should be supported , because the gap between developed and backward regions is still much"
13268,a new edition of the Brussels regulatory frenzy would be nothing more than a patch on

13270,"first of all , I would like to say that Socrates is a success story ."
13271,"this was already the case for education under Erasmus , but I think that it has been further increased"
13272,this is a positive finding of this evaluation of the second phase of the EU programme for

13275,"the second legal aspect that we are essentially concerned about is that , although we have"
13276,to do so would be to violate all the fundamental rights that have developed in the traditional order

13278,"I just wanted to say that for the sake of clarification , because many issues have been discuss"
13279,"I have , of course , voted in favour of the report , but I wanted to"

13282,"swine fever yes , foot-and-mouth disease is new to me ."
13283,"I have probably heard it before , but that is just one aspect of it ."
13284,"another point , and this is part of the compromise , Mr Goodwill , is that if"
13285,I would like to thank the two committees - the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee

13288,"it is true , however , that there is no permanent representation on the ground ."
13289,I can tell you that the Commission is currently considering a reorganisation of our foreign representations
13290,but there has not yet been a decision to change the situation in Paraguay in this respect .
13291,"now that two million cattle are to be killed and destroyed to relieve the market ,"
13292,"yes , ladies and gentlemen , two million older cattle are slaughtered in"
13293,so completely normal .
13294,only they then migrate to European stomachs and not to incineration plants .
13295,"but to now endeavour the ethics , I think it is far-fetched ."
13296,especially when we are now talking about Herod 's premiums in connection with a calf

13299,"with all the love and understanding for animal welfare , we want to leave the church in the"
13300,there is a difference between humans and animals .
13301,please do not forget this !

13335,that is why I am asking the Commission to do something about this .
13336,we have made demands and there is also broad agreement across the political groups in Parliament that something
13337,let us work together to find solutions that will enable peaceful developments .
13338,the following is important to me :
13339,that you should also present us with a report on the impact of your activities in the transition countries
13340,"secondly , we will never achieve harmonisation of holidays in Europe ."
13341,that is also part of the regulation .
13342,"I think that the grande nation France will never allow 14 July to be banned ,"
13343,that means that we have different driving bans due to different holidays anyway .
13344,"my question to you this evening , which I do not know if you can answer yet , is"
13345,"I find it difficult to explain why the Commission , on the one hand , in the report that"
13346,"therefore , I have some questions :"
13347,what do we say to the masters ?
13348,what should they do ?
13349,what treatment options are available ?
13350,"secondly , is the Commission aware that European production is declining further , disappearing from"
13351,"in this respect , it must become very clear for the future what the common foreign and security policy"
13352,"there must be concepts for this , and the Council and the Commission must be very clear on"
13353,we will of course also make our position very clear throughout this debate .
13354,we will use our powers as the budgetary authority to stop any such misconduct when
13355,today is not the time to be petty .
13356,the share of the common foreign and security policy at European level is still very small .
13357,we should not be petty at the beginning .
13358,"but we will watch very closely how everything develops , we will put our finger in the"
13359,that cannot be .
13360,"we will agree to this , but everyone should know that we will be very vigilant both in"

13365,I think that it is a deeply humane act and a truly remarkable responsibility
13366,that is why it is necessary for the EU mission in Moscow to at least observe this case
13367,Alexander Nikitin belongs free and honored !
13368,the EU budget – and this is quite clear – needs the potential to be able to respond to
13369,I am optimistic that we will manage to do so next year as well .
13370,if a company in France says that it has an employee who must work in Denmark all the time
13371,then the bureaucratic hurdles for this will be lower .
13372,"in return , however , we want to see no more obligations to report early , but only"
13373,I must therefore say that I am in favour of the amendments proposed by

13389,"I thank the Danes for not expelling Mr Sakayev - that was right , and"
13390,"but if Mr Sakayev can get political asylum in Europe , then something must have gone wrong"
13391,I think there should be no meeting with Russia without telling them that what is happening in

13406,we know from our Georgian friends from the national parliaments and from the embassy that has contact

13408,so these are really dramatic events .

13411,three final remarks on the subject .
13412,it is an important question where the electricity is produced .
13413,this depends on many factors .
13414,the committee will probably be open to the idea of finding and applying additional allocation signals

13453,"dare not only to talk about civil society in the glass palace of Parliament , but also"

13458,"first of all , I would like to thank my esteemed colleague Willy Piec"
13459,he has been committed to our ports and we should thank him for that .

13515,this time it really makes sense - my report was postponed so that yesterday 's

13529,"as regards regional disparities in development , this is a subject which the Commission takes very serious"
13530,"Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner very much for his answers ."
13531,he is really very credible here .

13533,"a small , perhaps naive , supplementary question : would it not be possible for either"
13534,I would be interested to talk to this woman personally .
13535,perhaps it would be interesting for the Commission to hear this from woman to man or from woman

13537,let me start with those which the Commission can accept in whole or in part .
13538,"in line with our new proposal for the ACP preference , the Commission can accept Amend"

13542,"as regards the recital on the ACP preference , we agree with EUR 3"
13543,we can therefore only accept Amendment No 16 in part .

13593,this means that companies – large or small – no longer have to provide fifteen different systems for

13595,a tax consensus between the Member States is only possible if the EU clearly defines the

13757,the White Paper provides for a consultation period until March 2002 .

13826,certain other areas are also eligible for this exemption .
13827,I would therefore like to say very clearly once again that we fully recognise what
13828,"there is a considerable implementation deficit here , which the government has also recognized and which"
13829,"until then , the Member States will have to reconsider how and where requirements and improvements"
13830,the time limit set by the Commission - it says that a decision must be taken within three months
13831,recognition procedures for diplomas obtained in third countries must also be simplified .
13832,we must open up within the EU so that citizens have the opportunity to use their skills in all
13833,we must be clear about that .
13834,that is the issue at hand .
13835,what the Commission has presented here is actually quite shameful .
13836,I want to make this very clear .
13837,why do we need basic quotas ?
13838,do we really want to use quotas to do what we have been doing with milk for more
13839,I am already hearing from peripheral countries today that they are happy to be able to
13840,"no , that can 't be the case , of course !"
13841,the quotas belong to the European Union and must be returned to it .
13842,only the European Union has the right to redistribute them .
13843,"above all , the credibility factor is present , because just as each individual has"
13844,you should use this accordingly .
13845,"credibility , that it is able to give security guarantees for a State of Israel and"
13846,let me now turn to what I think is a positive aspect of this directive .
13847,"the purpose of the Directive is to promote cogeneration technology , which can contribute to"
13848,cogeneration is being raised to the European Union ’ s energy policy agenda .
13849,the directive will give us a cogeneration policy in the Union .

13854,but that is exactly what we will get if we only emphasise intergovernmental

13856,it is precisely the small countries that end up suffering because the large ones dominate
13857,one of the greatest obstacles for EU representatives to take an active role in peace efforts

13860,"with this commitment and the approval of my report by the House , which I am very"
13861,I believe that Parliament should not lose sight of the three objectives of a high

13863,"I do not believe that the surplus situation in the dairy sector will improve , but rather"
13864,you can surely clarify it right in your admission .
13865,"in my view , there is no compelling market policy need for this , and that is"
13866,to explain this to the farmers at home would be a bit difficult for me .
13867,the best proof of this ' no ' is what we are providing with today 's
13868,we are responding with a parliamentary quick shot to a draft law in a Member State
13869,and what does this reaction look like ?
13870,"a single glance at the draft resolutions before us shows that the European Parliament , in"
13871,"that is right , but not enough !"
13872,we need legal certainty for ports and port companies .
13873,we need to know which financing of port infrastructure is not aid and does not need to
13874,we therefore need clear and binding guidelines .
13875,"if we measure these goals against reality , the extent of what still needs to be done"
13876,"the social function of agriculture , the general economic environment , the stability of international trade relations"
13877,"can it really be , Minister Moscovici , that governments are afraid to make rights"
13878,would the European Council and the member governments not admit to the world that they have considered
13879,would people not then be suspicious that the European Council and the governments of the
13880,that is the suspicion that is in the air !
13881,the answer to the first question is a clear yes .
13882,the proposal is in line with the regulation .
13883,the answer to the second question is not so easy .
13884,the intention of the agreement was to find a solution to the so-called whistle-

13886,this possibility is now excluded in the proposal before us when it comes to Members of

13888,"this protection goes beyond , for example , the protection that members of the EU Commission enjoy under this"
13889,I would like to take this opportunity to express my satisfaction at the Commission 's swift response
13890,the decision to make EUR 30 million available for emergency reconstruction aid was made possible
13891,"in addition , the European Investment Bank will provide medium-term loans of up to EUR"
13892,"if we really want to achieve the objective of increasing road safety , we need a multiface"

13900,"I therefore ask you to support Amendment 19 , which has been tabled"
13901,I repeat my old criticism that abuse is systemic because of the structures .
13902,I appeal to the Member States to make greater efforts to put an end to this abuse
13903,cooperation with other Member States and stricter scrutiny in the own country are absolutely

13905,only in this way will we be able to exert pressure on other countries at international conferences
13906,"we - that is to say , all those who will be attending the ACP-EU"
13907,"we will also have to ask South Africa , above all , to do justice to its important role"
13908,"unfortunately , despite the economic difficulties , we will also have to resort to strength"
13909,but let me say again that if the African neighbours were to help in jointly
13910,this agricultural policy is not only harming small and medium-sized producers in
13911,they are played against each other .
13912,this must be said and seen clearly here .
13913,"when I see , Mr Armado , that in a country like Brazil , with an area of"
13914,these are just examples of the Commission 's tasks .
13915,it is of course not acceptable that we should wait until after enlargement to negotiate

13979,perhaps the Commission could look internally in its services to see where the error lies – I
13980,I consider the possibility of enriching our daily diet with additional vitamins and minerals
13981,"when we talk about dietary supplements today , we mainly mean vitamins , minerals"
13982,the directive on food supplements aims to align the legislation in the Member States .
13983,producers will thus have easier access to all markets under uniform production and marketing
13984,perhaps the main point – and that is why it is so important to us – is that
13985,it is about the application of an extraterritorial law .
13986,"in this respect , we have the appropriate political support for the Commission ’ s and the"
13987,the strong will for integration at the time did not make us think about who and how much

13994,"if the state wants to have a comprehensive network of citizens ' assistance , it should"
13995,that would be a real overstatement of universal service .
13996,"so , guaranteeing universal service , yes , and to achieve that , we have to exclude"
13997,the big dispute in the committee and here in the House is :
13998,how large must the area be that we exclude from competition in order to enable a reason
13999,I think that the compromise we have now reached on 150g letters and
14000,that is why the majority of my group will support this compromise .
14001,I would consider it a disastrous path – and our group would do the same – if
14002,"imagine if there were , as is emerging these days – I do not want to talk"
14003,it would be a horror vision if Europe were to present itself in this way .
14004,that is why we must act within the Community framework .
14005,everything we do now must be done together .
14006,I am pleased that we have succeeded in shifting the focus of the report in the

14028,"in my reflection , I have come to the conclusion that , on the basis of plausi"
14029,the Commission has set sustainable development as its third priority .
14030,"this also concerns many individual budgets and programmes - the energy programme , the research programme"
14031,"for me , debt reduction means taking responsibility for the future ."
14032,"for me , debt reduction and annual deficit reduction means a radical change of policy ,"
14033,the Stability and Growth Pact is therefore a question of responsibility for the future
14034,on the other hand - let us be honest - it is a truly successful binding frame
14035,I therefore believe that we have taken a first important step towards greater competition and greater

14037,I would just like to remind you that we currently have 80 cases pending in

14049,"whether a fusion power plant will be built later or not , our descendants will decide"
14050,but we should give them that option .
14051,the relationship between the EU as donor and the Office of the High Representative and the Organisation
14052,this relationship is indeed not easy .
14053,the Commission is criticised for some of the administrative shortcomings which should be addressed to
14054,it is not about denying responsibility .
14055,"it only shows that there are sometimes difficulties in cooperation , which are partly structural"
14056,"as in the 1999 annual report , the Court of Auditors now proposes"
14057,but how can the Commission support international organisations with a purely political mandate if they have

14059,"that is why my group has also decided to call for an update of the investigation , and"
14060,the political responsibility of this House requires that we draw the right conclusions for the future
14061,we have made good progress with our work .
14062,I am confident that I will be presenting the proposals to the Commission by the end

14064,we regret that it has not been possible to establish a separate legal basis for support for border
14065,"on the other hand , we welcome the focus on giving greater consideration to the connection"
14066,I would like to mention one more point :
14067,I would really like to point out that the common agricultural policy certainly already takes account
14068,what I do not think is necessarily related to the follow-up of BSE is the

14077,"we must recognise that , in the democratic field , we have not maintained the"
14078,"wherever majority decisions are used in legislation , codecision is used ."
14079,"we have four essential areas , including structural policy , including Article 133 and two"
14080,that means that the democratic deficit has grown again .
14081,"moreover , the number of seats in the European Parliament is being determined against our wish"
14082,I think this is an unbearable state .
14083,in view of the fact that there are some 10 million unemployed in the European

14086,macroeconomic dialogue is a constructive way of addressing the pressing problems .
14087,I therefore call on all those involved to take a responsible part in this macroeconomic dialogue

14102,is there not a strong case for the costs of joint Petersberg tasks to be borne

14119,"nevertheless , I am very grateful to Mr Färm , because this has of"
14120,let me make just a few comments on this .
14121,"firstly , Commissioner , I find it somewhat strange that we have an supplementary budget"
14122,"on the other hand , in drawing up the 2003 budget , we have"
14123,something is wrong here .
14124,"this has relatively little to do with the budgetary imperative of truth , clarity"
14125,"accordingly , the European Public Prosecutor , as a coordinating authority , can make"
14126,"I also believe that the real players , the economic players , should be involved more intensively in"
14127,"for large corporations , the WTO is no longer the central issue – McDonald 's is"
14128,by maintaining the controversial Annex XV in the Accession Treaty and thereby

14130,"when we talk about mobility in Europe today , the place of training should not necessarily be"
14131,"if this certificate is valid throughout Europe , it should also be possible to do the training throughout Europe"
14132,"we are also aware , however , that although this is an interesting and important directive ,"
14133,"Mr van Dam has just referred to the bilateral licences which are still valid in Europe ,"
14134,we also know that certain companies are still taking advantage of the possibility - and I am
14135,"because even within the 15 Member States , there is exaggeration in these areas"
14136,"I do not want to mention the names of companies here , but we know some names in this"
14137,the European Union has just issued a statement emphasising that President Fujimori has taken an
14138,"this initiative can represent a significant step towards democracy , but only if he no longer runs"
14139,"in the area of pesticides , too – and this has already been called for – we must"
14140,let me say one more thing :
14141,it is totally irresponsible to talk about the industry 's own responsibility and to
14142,"we in the European Parliament , and I am addressing this to the large groups , must tell"
14143,I would remind you that in 1995 – when I was the rapporteur
14144,"we confirmed this once again a few years later in the report by Mr Newman , for"
14145,we therefore thank the Commission for having initiated this legislative process .
14146,it is not the first time that we have been dealing with this issue .
14147,we have made a number of offers to this country - and this is a particularly disappoint
14148,I cannot therefore agree with the recommendation for second reading as tabled by a majority of

14150,the moment of truth is coming in Nice .
14151,the summit will only be successful if it decides on a truly comprehensive reform

14154,the strengthening of democracy requires that the European Parliament be granted the right of codecision
14155,the following points are given special importance in the new Convention .
14156,"firstly , greater consideration should be given to the local dietary habits of the"
14157,"secondly , donor countries can now express their commitments in terms of quantity , value"
14158,"thirdly , the members of the Convention must give priority to the least developed countries and the"
14159,"fourthly , there are stricter provisions on the promotion of local agricultural development"
14160,more than half of the Commission 's relevant budget is spent on this type of transaction .
14161,"we Parliamentarians must therefore continue to insist on the Agency 's maximum independence ,"
14162,we want the Agency 's other directors to be appointed on the proposal of the

14164,we Liberals welcome the action programme proposed by the Commission to combat discrimination .

14167,the transmission of traditional values such as tolerance and respect for diversity can contribute much
14168,"Mr President , I voted in favour of the Turmes report ."
14169,I think that this was an excellent report and I must once again give Mr Turmes a very

14171,the German Presidency has played its part in strengthening the common house of Europe .
14172,we express the hope that the learning processes that have been made by all those involved during this
14173,"the European Parliament , however , now has to play its part and continue to work in precisely"
14174,"your report also points to structural problems , to errors in the European Union 's policy"
14175,I would like to give the example of the common agricultural policy and quote from your report
14176,"with regard to the greening of the common agricultural policy , the Court concluded that"
14177,this is actually the opposite of what we should achieve with our resources .
14178,"there are numerous shortcomings in the Council directive , in the environmental criteria ,"
14179,"however , this is not only the responsibility of the Commission or Parliament , but primarily of"
14180,"I would like to refer to an example that you gave and which I find very informative ,"
14181,I quote : ‘ The aid rate for artificially dried feed is almost twice as
14182,this prompted the producers to adjust accordingly and produce the maximum amount of artificially drie
14183,production within the European Union has been above the guaranteed maximum quantities since 199

14185,"secondly , 11 September has made it even clearer that the largest redistribution"
14186,"for them , 11 September would probably be an opportunity if they took a credible step"
14187,I would also like to emphasise the third point very clearly .
14188,we are creating an institution that is almost comparable to what the Americans already have .
14189,we all know that the FAA has relatively large influence – even worldwide – because it
14190,"we Europeans are of course lagging behind , because when the individual nation states act , it"
14191,I therefore believe that this is the right step in the right direction .
14192,I believe that the large number of formal notices and court proceedings brought before the European
14193,the Member States are clearly in the spotlight .
14194,"we , as Members of Parliament , should also take action at home ."
14195,the demand for more direct control powers for the Commission in the environmental sector on the ground in

14197,"fourthly , the underdeveloped regions still do not have self-sustaining"
14198,this means that they have enormous problems actually reducing the gap with the more developed countries .
14199,I therefore conclude by reiterating the committee 's proposal to reject the directiv
14200,"Mr President , the original version of this motion is the German version , the Spanish version is"
14201,"I just wanted to point out once again that we are voting on the German version , na"
14202,the Spanish version reads ‘ or the Board of Directors ’ .
14203,that is something completely different .
14204,another key issue : the threshold for the accidental or technically unavoidable
14205,"in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , the threshold for the"
14206,we agree that this threshold is purely a political value and has no scientific basis .
14207,"as a political value , however , this value must be based on what is practicable , what"
14208,"however , the feasibility threshold is already more than met with a lower limit of"
14209,a threshold of 0.5 % is simply not achievable at present .
14210,"it would be an impediment value , an impediment threshold ."
14211,"I propose , and the Committee on Budgets has followed me here , that we introduce an improvement"
14212,"we are proposing that we provide for new posts in certain areas , but only where this is"
14213,"we will have to examine this very closely in the coming weeks and months , because we have"
14214,we have developed a very sensible building policy as regards the costs of the European Parliament 's

14217,"that is why I would like to say at the outset that I think you , Mr Sch"
14218,"here , it is a ritual to thank the rapporteur ;"
14219,"but in this case I want to do so in a special way , namely by telling"
14220,"the Secretary-General of the Berlin CDU , a very important regional branch of the Christian Democratic"
14221,"your party leadership in Berlin – I mean the leadership at the federal level , not the leadership in"

14233,"with additional efforts , it must be possible – and I am convinced it is possible – to"
14234,"we are fully aware of Turkey 's concerns , particularly with regard to possible actions in"

14238,"firstly , health is not and must not be a purely economic good ."
14239,"secondly , equal access to health services is a fundamental right and must remain so ."

14244,we have practiced this so far .
14245,"that means that elections have to take place , as in the committees ."
14246,that there are agreements between the groups is another matter .
14247,"in other words , the decisions on interparliamentary delegations are taken by the"

14259,"this will harmonise and simplify the existing rules , which lacked uniformity ."
14260,we are using the same sales promotion concept that is already being used outside the European Union .
14261,this will provide the Union with a flexible instrument for support in the internal market that can be used
14262,this means that the old product-oriented strategy is replaced by a concept with a strong

14265,"however , I think that part of Amendment No 42 , which makes the award"
14266,I will in any case make such a proposal to the Council .
14267,the third topic is the Palestinian Authority .
14268,we have tabled a motion to place funds in the reserve .
14269,we are concerned about ensuring that European taxpayers ' money is used properly
14270,the International Monetary Fund has not been able to confirm that it is doing all that we natural

14272,there is an open letter saying that the chocolate directive is the last nail in the coffin
14273,I consider such a distortion of reality and emotionalization of the debate to be extreme
14274,"it is clear that we have asked for the list , because it comes from the developing countries"
14275,it is clear that this will still bring benefits to the developing countries .
14276,we have a similar situation in the field of foreign policy .
14277,anyone looking at future developments in the field of external aid must expect that there will
14278,I will simply give Kaliningrad as an example .
14279,we will of course also take a very critical look at the European Union 's external aid
14280,the citizens can be sure that there will be no visible problems at all until 200
14281,negotiations must be properly conducted for the period after that .
14282,everyone sitting at the table has a high degree of responsibility .
14283,"we as Parliament will be co-deciding on how this is going to be done ,"
14284,"we will , however , be very positive in our support of these issues , because we believe that"
14285,"the initiative of the Year of Sport or Education through Sport is a very good approach , which"
14286,I would nevertheless like to raise one point of criticism on which I agree with
14287,the title of the Year of Education through Sport is to limit the activities to schools only .
14288,"I cannot agree with this , because I believe that associations and organisations must be involved in"
14289,"education through sport is not only done in schools , but primarily in clubs and many ,"
14290,I believe that the Year of Education through Sport must also be a signal and a recognition of

14294,"it is a good day for the seas of Europe and also for you personally , Mr"
14295,"if you can dive in even cleaner waters in Europe , we will all be happy together ."
14296,but it is primarily about the oceans .
14297,I am also opposed to a uniform cofinancing rate of 20 % for all

14299,"for youth organisations , a percentage of 20 % is the maximum , because it is"
14300,it was the right decision to nominate Winfried Menrad as the author of the 2
14301,his excellent work – produced under considerable time pressure – is something with which all three committees
14302,less would have been more .
14303,the second reason is that this motion makes demands which have not been considered or discussed
14304,we therefore ask that this item be withdrawn and replaced by a truly urgent

14306,"we will , of course , continue to monitor closely how the situation will develop after the introduction"

14326,I believe that these are important tasks that should be tackled on the basis of this
14327,to agree to this regulation would be simply nonsense and would ultimately damage the image of this

14349,the Commission and the Council probably did not expect that there would be an - I would almost say

14351,I recommend to Parliament that it adopt the Frassoni report in this sense .

14362,Mr Rübig praised the Commissioner so much that I do not know how to praise him

14382,"in the meantime , I think it would be very sensible – and I would also support Mrs"
14383,perhaps there is a possibility that we can create a special status for those countries which have
14384,I fully support Mrs Napoletano 's approach as such .
14385,I believe that this compromise provides sufficient protection for workers ' rights .
14386,there is no reason to go beyond that .
14387,I would therefore ask you to reject these amendments - otherwise the whole compromis
14388,that is the clear information we have received from the Council .
14389,as important and indispensable as decisions on the future institutional structure of Europe are
14390,the future of Europe must not be limited to the market and the single currency .
14391,"I welcome the fact that the French Prime Minister , Mr Jospin , in his recent speech focus"
14392,"indeed , the debate on the content of the European Union 's policies is more urgent"
14393,it is not about quotas and positive discrimination .
14394,let me say that the term itself is absurd .
14395,how can discrimination be positive ?
14396,"I want my job not because I am a woman , but because I am qualified for it"

14406,so again : the corresponding IPSA standards of the International Federation of Accountants are the
14407,"these standards do not yet cover all the issues , so there is indeed an ongoing"
14408,"above all , it will be important for us to establish an international competition order ."
14409,this competition regulation is all the more important because it is of little use to the development of the
14410,"I am thinking of the elephant weddings , I am thinking of the mergers , I"
14411,it is not acceptable that the world 's 100 largest companies should divide the

14414,"despite all the financial incentives , such protections often tend to discourage the employment"
14415,"Furthermore , however , the Skinner report raises the fundamental question of what Europe should"
14416,"in other words , it is about the question of competences and a sensible subsidiarity ."
14417,we cannot talk about a global partnership for sustainable development without drawing attention to the link between
14418,poverty causes population growth .
14419,it is estimated that by 2015 there will be 7.5 billion
14420,"this means increased pressure on natural resources , and increased pressure on the environment ."
14421,"in this context , I would like to point out how important it is to continue to emphasi"
14422,"Madam President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first"
14423,I sincerely thank all of them .
14424,"without the interplay of all we would not have reached this now quite comfortable , because"
14425,"in any case , it seems that there will be no further obstacles to Parliament 's decision"
14426,"much has already been said about the content of the directive , and I would like to concentra"
14427,"first , the topic of “ scope of universal service obligations ” ."
14428,"firstly , it is welcome that the universal service should include basic Internet connections but not broad"
14429,"in some parts of the Community , the infrastructure required for broadband connections cannot be developed or"
14430,"in addition , there is not yet sufficient demand for such connections ."
14431,"consequently , it should be left to market forces to offer such connections without any regulator"
14432,the financial framework – and this has also been said – for the implementation of this regulation
14433,I would therefore ask that we give our approval to these 11 million tomorrow
14434,gender mainstreaming is a word that has been used a great deal and perhaps
14435,Germany is blocking a humanization of refugee and immigration policy in almost all areas .
14436,any proposal from the Commission that goes in this direction is rejected by the German Interior Minister .
14437,I am sure that Mr Schily would agree wholeheartedly with a proposal as it
14438,the second important thing – and that is why Tampere was a success – is :

14440,"in asylum policy it is important to make a clear commitment to the Geneva Convention , to"
14441,"in migration policy , it was important to make a clear statement that there is a commitment"

14444,I know - because I cannot think of an answer at this point - that it is an enorm
14445,"nevertheless , I believe that we will seize this opportunity , that we will succeed"
14446,"I therefore consider this to be a very great success , not only for the environment but also"
14447,I believe that it is also essential that consumers should be able to be more confident in

14449,I think it is very important that we have managed to regulate this individual cost allocation and
14450,I would also ask the Commission to strictly monitor and demand this individual cost allocation in the future
14451,only then will we truly make this directive a milestone for environmental and consumer protection .
14452,"Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and I am"

14456,the European Union is therefore right to want to focus on full employment .
14457,"I consider this to be a scandal , because the dioxin debate was a problem for the Member"
14458,I think it would have been decent of them to be represented here today at a high
14459,"we have the problem , time and again , that the Member States do not implement what the Commission"
14460,I would like to reply to Mrs Dührkop Dührkop that the priorities which this
14461,I therefore pointed out that you should be provided with information in good time on where difficult
14462,you have just given examples where I can assure you that these are expenditures which I

14464,"on the other hand , if there are savings – I would say – as a result of"
14465,"it is essential for us at European level , in the European Parliament , to retain our influence"
14466,this does not mean that we also want to discuss the technical details in plenary or in committee
14467,that is not the point for us .
14468,"however , it is essential for us to retain influence if things go in the wrong direction ,"
14469,it is therefore essential that the Commission and the Convention support us in this and that we can

14488,"we , as the European Parliament , have an obligation to ensure that press freedom is respected"
14489,perhaps in future we should respect even more the people 's right to plurality of opinion
14490,it would therefore be consistent if Mr Poettering asked his colleagues in Forza

14492,"we welcome your intentions , Mr President-in-Office , for Ghent and Laeken"
14493,"we hope that it will not remain just intentions , but that what you have presented here"
14494,we were very pleased that Li Peng has fulfilled the promise he made to finally contact the

14496,"of course , the report is not consistent ."
14497,there are contradictions .

14499,"firstly , it is an unequivocal criticism of Saddam Hussein 's ir"
14500,he formulates the necessary demands .
14501,secondly – and I have just read this differently – it highlights the crucial issue for

14503,"this would have the most threatening consequences in this region , including for our overall relationship"
14504,I am very pleased to be able to tell you that the reactions have been positive throughout
14505,"the starting point for our proposals for a new neighbourhood policy is , of course"
14506,what is needed for the coming decade is primarily a differentiated strategy for intensive good
14507,"our intention is to export the stability , security and prosperity that we have created and hope"
14508,"President Prodi has described this as the ring of friends that surrounds us , a ring"

14511,"in its original proposal for a new regulation , the Commission proposed to create a general legal basis"
14512,Parliament has voted in favour of creating a special legal basis for the two administrative units
14513,I think that it is indeed necessary to enter into this compromise in order to take
14514,"on behalf of the Commission , I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the rapport"
14515,the compromise reached between France and the Commission and Great Britain was that the tests should be used
14516,these demands were also made by Germany .
14517,my question is : if you are already initiating infringement proceedings but
14518,"in recent weeks , the German government has made an additional DM 70 million available for projects"
14519,I think that is a very important sign .
14520,"similarly , the examination of a ban on the NPD is a very important social"
14521,we do not allow ourselves to be terrorized by a minority in Germany either .
14522,this is a test of our democracy .

14524,"I myself and many others throughout Germany condemn right-wing radicalism and xenophobia ,"
14525,the Turkish parliament recently passed a law to relax the conditions of solitary confinement .
14526,only prisoners convicted under the Anti-Terrorism Act are allowed to participate in
14527,I criticize this law because it does not allow all prisoners to participate in the community

14529,at last we can establish privileged economic and political relations with the country in Africa whose

14531,"by maintaining a special relationship with South Africa , we are supporting its economic development and at"
14532,I would like to conclude by appealing to the Council :
14533,the economic policy guidelines require the cooperation of all of us .
14534,when the report calls for the EU market for financial services to be integrated and efficient
14535,the economic policy guidelines will be implemented with the active cooperation of the Council .
14536,it is time for this !
14537,we have done so because we want this Convention to be a success .
14538,"that is our unanimous conviction , and I would like to make it clear here ."
14539,"on this premise , we also approve this supplementary and amending budget which the Committee"

14549,I believe that this change in awareness shows that adults in all situations of life actually consider

14570,this is a text of high quality !
14571,"Mr President , the rapporteur has clearly explained the meaning of the text in the sense"
14572,"you have read the English version , which is accepted by the overwhelming majority of those"
14573,"I would really ask you to allow the vote to continue now , especially since these semantic games"
14574,"if you look at the process concerning cage chickens , we have already made substantial"
14575,"if I look at consumer behaviour after the discussions in recent years , I can already"
14576,but I would like to warn against taking the Commissioner 's statement that 85 % of

14578,"if I asked a citizen on the street , “ Would you do more for animal"

14803,anyone who has ever picked up this 200-page document will find that

15090,"I have been asking myself this question for a few days now , and , Mr Prodi"
15091,that was now a total of four or five .
15092,I will also tell you the answer : I am not hopeful .
15093,I have the impression that in the past you have made lip service .
15094,that was too much for you .
15095,that is why you have not done so today .
15096,"in your speech today , you did not say a word , not a single one , about environmental"
15097,you mentioned sustainable development .

15151,we have many proposals for improvement from the committee .
15152,we are convinced that we have discussed this at a broad level and have put it forward
15153,"but first of all , a clarification is necessary , which we also want to make clear"
15154,this is the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the activities

15156,it is not a directive that regulates occupational pensions as a product and also from

15161,I cannot say the same for the Russian minority in Latvia .
15162,there is no social debate at all about the success and problems of enlargement or accession process
15163,the communication strategy is a separate project between East and West and as such already structurally wrong .
15164,it prevents getting to know each other .
15165,how many people in the West know about the European treasures in the Baltic cultures

15200,"the advantage of this new structure is already clear , especially in Norway , when we are now"
15201,I therefore ask the Commission to reconsider its reluctant position on this issue .
15202,we should send a clear signal to the other institutions by adopting the committee 's report .
15203,"Mr President , much has already been said today about Turkey ."
15204,"this is not surprising at all , because this Parliament is a mirror of the population of the"

15206,was the statement made by the Council representative today not very clear ?
15207,but we are not under any pressure at all .
15208,the Copenhagen criteria have not been met and they are not negotiable .
15209,"in this context , I would like to thank Mr Verheugen for his clear statement today on"
15210,"Madam President , Mr Poettering has just mentioned the European party statute in connection with the"

15215,there were governments who wanted to see parties from two countries already obtaining this status .
15216,"that cannot be true , the European statute cannot be concealed funding for national or"
15217,I just wanted to put that on record so that there is no wrong impression or debate .
15218,"therefore , the recommendations listed in point 2 , such as promoting the development"
15219,the scope of the so-called political dialogue should perhaps be defined more precis
15220,we didn ’ t even think that was possible at first .
15221,"we then worked very actively on this in committee , but the view I am now explaining"
15222,we then tried to discuss whether it would not be possible to buy products within the EU at world
15223,"when I speak of time , I would like to return to an idea that I pursued"
15224,fulfilment of this political criterion is the prerequisite for us to be able
15225,that is the point and purpose of the whole exercise we are undertaking here with this report .

15227,"I would like to say a half sentence about why there is no joint resolution here , but rather"
15228,this is because we held a meeting on Tuesday with the aim of finding a joint resolution
15229,that is why we said we would take these controversial points out and only include the essential

15231,Commissioner Verheugen has also made it very clear that Parliament should have an opinion on this issue
15232,"if I may now comment on the first block , we have just rejected Amendment No"
15233,"the problem we have is that we have not reached a decision in committee on this subject , on"
15234,the Liberal Group has now tried to introduce what we have done for gas in parallel for electricity .

15236,"however , we now have in Amendment No 147 , which belongs"
15237,"in the case of gas , we prefer something that we do not want to do in the case"
15238,"however , we always want to open gas with a delay compared to electricity ."
15239,now we are breaking the system at this very point .
15240,"that means that , by analogy , we would have to be against No 147"
15241,"therefore , Mr President , you must now decide whether we take out Amendment No"
15242,"then this would have to be rejected , as in the vote that has just taken place ."

15319,I have drawn it up and it will be on Parliament 's table shortly .
15320,I very much hope that we can cooperate closely on this issue as well .
15321,the fifth directive is therefore already on its way .

15336,that is an interesting question .
15337,the difference is obviously independent of governments .
15338,it was a Conservative government before and now it is a Labour government and nothing has changed .
15339,why is public opinion in the UK different from that on the other side of the Channel ?
15340,"that would be a question that would be perfectly appropriate to discuss in this round ,"
15341,that was my first point .
15342,we welcome the close cooperation that has now been established between Hungary and the Slovak Republic .
15343,we are particularly pleased that Slovakia is on the way to granting the Hungarian minority

15402,this has never happened before in the history of Europe and the world !
15403,what 's new ?
15404,I would like to mention just six points that seem particularly important to me .
15405,"of course , I also have points of criticism ."
15406,many initiatives can still be improved in detail .
15407,"firstly , the Commission should , in particular , further improve and speed up cooperation with the"
15408,"decentralization has great advantages , but it requires effective information management ."
15409,the Symmetry system developed by the Commission will significantly improve the flow of information to and
15410,"at the same time , however , a link with the Youth programme and Leonardo da Vinci is"
15411,Symmetry must therefore be deployed as soon as possible .
15412,reference is always made to the Infrastructure Costs Directive .
15413,but I have already heard the arguments in relation to the infrastructure cost directive .
15414,"if you look at Mr Cocilovo 's proposal , you can already see that people do"
15415,it is comforted from one proposal to the next .
15416,let us make a general regulation !
15417,"I am grateful for the regulation , but it is not sufficient for me ."
15418,"however , if this Parliament and certain groups or Members in particular are then willing to reduce this"
15419,I will stick with that .
15420,"when I listen today and when I look back on the last few days , I am surprised"
15421,I have just heard Mr Goodwill say that he did not sign compromise Amendment No
15422,I signed them because they are compromises .
15423,the best of all worlds is another .
15424,I imagine them differently .
15425,"but , for example , the compromise amendment was drawn up , among other things"
15426,"one problem is that the two main exits lead into the foyer , which is extremely"
15427,there are the bridges .
15428,the cameras are waiting .
15429,"we MEPs are of course also very undisciplined , we talk in the corridors"
15430,we could certainly improve our discipline .
15431,but I think we should think of something to make better use of the wide foyers on the
15432,"when we get out there , we should also have the opportunity to sit together for a while on"
15433,but my main point is that I have taken on the Committee on Fisheries ’ reporting on

15435,"however , we are not prepared for disasters in terms of individual budget lines , neither"

15439,but we in Parliament must help the fishermen today .

15457,"Turkey must change its policy on crucial points , not only formally but also in practice ."
15458,only then will the prospect of accession be realistic .
15459,"despite these considerable concerns , I agreed to the Czech Republic 's accession"
15460,"however , it has become clear during the demonstrations that the protesters are not only concerned"
15461,"this verdict , like many others , is in reality not religiously motivated but politically"
15462,"we know this from Europe , when state and church were not yet separated ."
15463,Christianity was also instrumentalized beyond recognition by the rulers in order to assert their
15464,"the internal market is a central element in the success of enlargement , and I therefore understand"
15465,"nevertheless , I share the view of our rapporteur , Mr Wuermeling ,"

15467,"it is welcome that this agreement also gives the European Parliament some increased power , but that it also"
15468,"I do not want to run the risk that the little boy who always says “ EB , EB"

15477,I believe that we need standards in the evaluation of crime and that we need comparable

15479,"the second is , of course , the implementation of uniform and rapid asylum procedures and"

15481,we therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to pay due attention in future to the

15483,"this , however , has reduced the employment effects of structural policy accordingly ."
15484,"this is not an evaluation , but simply a statement ."
15485,"what is the point of building an area of security , freedom and justice ?"
15486,"it is about security and fundamental rights , i.e. direct individual rights on the one hand"
15487,"these are two phenomena that can directly affect the citizens of Europe , each individually ."
15488,"there is therefore a direct link with almost all issues , whether it is asylum ,"
15489,but it is not just about access to the Kaliningrad region .
15490,behind it is of course the great Russia .
15491,there are other problems at borders .
15492,"if you think , for example , of the small border traffic between Poland and Ukraine or the border"
15493,"at first glance , the problems of corruption , social tensions and illegal human trafficking are"
15494,"the main difference , however , is that these societies are declared to be in a continuo"
15495,"for most of these eastern neighbours , their path leads to the EU at"
15496,"unlike North Africa , this gives us the opportunity to have a greater influence on the development"
15497,"we need preventive measures specifically tailored to Albania , which will help to build"
15498,"this would eliminate many reasons for emigration , asylum and flight ."
15499,"but what we need , on the other hand , are strict , uniform legal instruments for immigra"

15501,smuggling gangs are not service providers who thankfully save people from persecution by

15673,I think that tomorrow we will have a very effective vote in favour of our common ideal

15675,European citizens have clearly expressed their concerns and also shown that they expect concrete action
15676,"you , as Parliament , have also called on the Commission to take initiatives in this area through"
15677,the action we should take is part of the resolution that is before us today .
15678,it is about strengthening banking supervision .
15679,it is about clarifying liability for transactions .
15680,it is about a regulatory framework at international level .
15681,it is about reviewing national laws to see if they comply with the Basel Committee rules

15683,this debate is starting very late and I would ask for your understanding - because we all have other

15720,we must not let ourselves be instilled with the sedative of business as u

15722,"our most important proposal is that , in addition to labour and social law , collective agreements"
15723,"to avoid misunderstandings , I believe that the Committee on Industry could also agree to the"
15724,all these breathtaking changes are taking place without the European Parliament being given the slightest opportunity

15726,Parliament is not even given the right to send two representatives to the Supervisory Board .
15727,"as directly elected Members , we continue to depend on the newspapers to inform us ,"
15728,but the point is not that the directive we adopted in 1998 is

15730,it is a violation of this directive and we should therefore not call the directive

15733,the attempt to comply with driving and rest times with two drivers from Central or Eastern

15752,it is therefore in the interest of the European Union to put an end to a policy of
15753,the European Parliament did this before 1989 with regard to Central and Eastern Europe .
15754,it was relatively lonely at the time and has been proven right by development .
15755,"the European Parliament is doing this again today in relation to Vietnam , and I appeal to the Commission"
15756,only then can it be a meaningful partner in the long term .
15757,"Chancellor Schröder , known in Germany for his harsh tone ( discussions are"
15758,"instead , he loudly served his favorite target group , the media ."
15759,"the demand for more influence for Germany in the Council - namely more vote weight than France ,"
15760,"- was completely devalued as an easily understandable "" tactical manoeuvring mass"
15761,the last line that belongs to this compromise package of the groups is A-3
15762,it is about the International Centre for European Education .
15763,"everything is to be budgeted under the line , so there is no longer any reserve ,"
15764,these were the technical changes .
15765,"this has been agreed with the groups , and I would ask you to put this before the"
15766,"of course , the revision of the financial perspective is not an end in itself , but the Commission"
15767,I would like to ask once again – the Commission has left its proposal on the table – that

15769,this is already being successfully practiced in some Member States .
15770,"Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am very happy to see that the"
15771,"the previous speaker has rightly emphasised that the Christian Democratic Group , together with other groups"
15772,"however , we will not vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the Socialist"
15773,most of the previous speakers have pointed out that rejection is not in contradiction with
15774,"as for the second question , I agree with you ."
15775,that is precisely the objective of our efforts in Romania and with the Romanian Government to ensure
15776,"as I said , it is therefore not only a question of our own interests , how"
15777,"that is why we are not free to say , no we do this or we do not do"
15778,and this holds great possibilities .
15779,"if we act there , not as colonialists as in the past , but as partners willing to"
15780,Europeans must not let this opportunity pass up under any circumstances !
15781,"this agreement is , if you will , the door-opener for OLAF ."
15782,it regulates the duties and rights of those involved in investigations .
15783,we are therefore giving a clear answer to the much-discussed “ whist
15784,any official who has concrete evidence of the existence of cases of fraud or corruption will not only
15785,he must not suffer any disadvantages for this reason .
15786,the European Union is not a state .
15787,"but where it has competences , it works like a federal state ."
15788,"for this reason , the relationship between the institutions must also be regulated in this way on a"
15789,this is certainly one of the difficult tasks of this Intergovernmental Conference .
15790,I can well imagine – and this is the view of my group – that it is possible to
15791,"I therefore call for a return to a factual debate , because the problems are big enough"
15792,I believe that we should really stick to what Mrs Langenhagen said : we are not
15793,we really want to achieve a situation that looks more hopeful for the future of our fish stock
15794,we must work together on this .
15795,"thirdly , we must prepare for the enlargement of the European Union , and we as Parliament"
15796,"this cannot mean , however - and this is a particularly important point - that we will already"
15797,that is the wrong way to make a decision .
15798,it is not the task of the budget to make such fundamental political decisions .
15799,"these must be taken elsewhere , which means that we must of course talk to language schools"
15800,a framework programme could provide the necessary transparency of Community health activities and the necessary

15802,"this , however , requires a clear and unambiguous mandate for the Commission , which"
15803,as regards the talks aimed at a political settlement under the auspices of the
15804,I would also like to point out that the Committee on Agriculture will pay particular attention to the fact

15806,"we are pleased with EUR 300 million , but it cannot be that they are"
15807,"it must be additional funding , otherwise we would have a contradiction in promoting a"

15811,"above all , there are shortcomings in the practical implementation of the guidelines"
15812,the Joint Employment Report 1999 mentions in this context the lack

15818,the Italians say that we will start building when the Austrians start building .
15819,the Germans say that we will start building when the Austrians start building .
15820,the Austrians say that we will start when the Germans and Italians start building .
15821,"in other words , we now need clear standards and clear data on who pays what and when"
15822,"Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I welcome the fact that we have"
15823,"first of all , however , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Langen ,"
15824,"I would also like to thank the head of the delegation to the Conciliation Committee ,"
15825,"as Mr Langen has just said , it was a very tough battle in the Concili"
15826,all that remains is to carefully examine the details of the summit agreements in the
15827,"in the post-Nice process , substantial changes must be made to previous decisions ."
15828,the citizens of Europe deserve a substantial improvement .
15829,we know that no nuclear power plant is completely safe and that some are not up to date in
15830,it would be all the more surprising if there were indeed a letter from Commissioner Verhe
15831,"since this statement would contradict all the findings of international experts on Temelin , I cannot"
15832,"I therefore ask the Commission to submit this letter , which has been sent to the Czech and"
15833,"we have been very committed to this issue and I think Parliament deserves it , even"
15834,the report goes quite far in its demands .
15835,whether this will bring the act of concealing information in breach of a specific obligation
15836,it is necessary - and this shows the full scope of the report - to repeated
15837,"Mr President , Madam Vice-President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start"
15838,one thing must be clarified here : the thesis that the Community is breaking contract law
15839,"contract law provides for adjustments , and what is being proposed here is to adapt the law"
15840,this is not a breach of contract .
15841,if the Liberal Member of this House is lamenting that we are not dealing properly
15842,when will you provide the money to build the Brenner Base Tunnel ?
15843,then you are doing something for the environment !
15844,we are far behind schedule in the implementation of the Brenner base tunnel .
15845,this is the only real solution for Alpine transit .
15846,"you should not be making great statements here , Mrs Großmann , but you"
15847,that would be your job in a government in which you are represented !
15848,we don 't need legends !
15849,"the European Union regularly raises the issues of human rights violations , arbitrary arrests"
15850,at the 57th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in March
15851,I believe that everyone in Europe has recognised that this is a high priority and that
15852,"in order to put some pressure on them , I think we must also adopt this action plan ."
15853,one more word on the developing countries : I am really glad that they have now been dis
15854,the Everything but Arms initiative will not kill anyone or cost anything .
15855,we must also look at which countries are trying to sell some of the little they produce because they
15856,you have to take a look at this .
15857,"for decades , we in the European Union have dumped our surpluses at world market"
15858,we should also remember that .
15859,"but , as you see , good things take time , and there will certainly be another opportunity"
15860,"there is certainly nothing in the human realm that is black or white , and we all"
15861,"my last point is that anti-racism , as it is stated here , would mean"
15862,what does the report do ?
15863,"the report does not take action against institutional racism , where Eurodac is only the"
15864,"therefore , as an anti-racist , you cannot take this report seriously at all"
15865,"the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy has not fully adopted the view"
15866,the trade in medicines and the protection of cultural diversity will play an important role for me
15867,I would ask the Commission to pay particular attention to both areas .
15868,"similar to rural development , the same applies to the common organisations of the market ."
15869,"these also take account of the specific characteristics of extensive agriculture , particularly in"
15870,"yes , we do , because we do not consider the protection of human rights to be an internal"
15871,but sometimes individual events are of great relevance for the protection of human rights .
15872,the fact that Mr Milosevic is on trial in The Hague has been making many dicta
15873,such a procedure against a former government leader is classic preventive human rights policy .
15874,I can only advise certain rulers to beware of the future .
15875,they won 't get away with it !
15876,even the earthly justice will overtake them .
15877,the current situation in the Middle East is increasingly showing the need for action in the frame

15882,this process was completed by the end of 1993 .
15883,"there is nothing left to decide , the issue is over ."
15884,there was a discussion at the time that the involvement of the population was not sufficient .
15885,"every German colleague will confirm this to me , and I reminded them of this"
15886,"on the question of representativeness , that is , how many Member States must have representatives"
15887,"I would like to point out that , after a long discussion , the Commission explicitly chose"
15888,would an adjustment have to be made in each case ?
15889,what does a quarter mean in terms of the number of 21 or 23 Member
15890,this means that extra regulations would have to be found all the time .
15891,"for this reason , we therefore explicitly propose the number 5 ."
15892,"thirdly , I fully support the new provision that , in tunnels that cross the"
15893,"as regards the reform of the Council , the outcome is not so glorious , particular"
15894,"it is actually ridiculous that transparency only concerns a part of legislation , and"
15895,we should not be afraid of the transparency that exists in this Parliament .
15896,full transparency is what we are also demanding from the Council for the entire legislative procedure
15897,"and it will be very , very difficult to influence from the outside because the human right to free"
15898,and that is why – and I am addressing the Commission in particular – we need to show
15899,"it is not impossible to transform society even in this situation , as time has shown eleven"
15900,"gender budgeting is not about drawing up separate budgets for men and women , but"
15901,"public budgets are not gender neutral , as we often hear , they have a different impact on"
15902,we want to highlight these differences and take them into account .
15903,this also allows the administrative burden to be distributed on two levels .
15904,"as a resident of a border community , I personally know that there is a lot to be"
15905,"we will therefore , of course , vote in such a way that we may refer the proposal"
15906,it is a strange coincidence that a trial of which I am not 100
15907,"sometimes in history , bad events trigger a positive development ."
15908,the question we must ask ourselves – and I think Mr Karas ’ s formulation
15909,a good employment policy and low unemployment are the prerequisites for real growth .
15910,we will only have growth if the products that are produced are also marketable .
15911,"that is , they are coupled together ."
15912,we therefore need to think about how economic and social policy can be decidedly better designed together
15913,"during Question Time today , I asked the Commission how many jobs would be lost if production in"
15914,Commissioner Byrne was quite right to say that he prioritises public health .
15915,this morning we have talked about environmental protection .
15916,it was said that environmental protection is a priority .
15917,I believe that we should come up with an objective procedure that will secure new jobs .
15918,"for this , we also need , above all , proper representation of employers ' organisations"
15919,"I believe that this sector should be supported even more at European level in future , because it"
15920,I am also in favour of liberalisation in the interests of consumers .
15921,"but if liberalisation allows for excesses such as those I have just illustrated , which"
15922,"we have to consider all of this , and it is not the job of the post to create"
15923,"if we concentrate on what the postal service 's core business is and on a sensible ,"
15924,I would ask you to support the compromise that we have reached in our committee .
15925,the majority of ministers have not yet been up to the task they are facing .
15926,that is simply true .
15927,"there is no will to create the Intergovernmental Conference , but rather an obstructionist"
15928,"the proposals that are being made are almost all , without exception , steps backwards from the"
15929,"every time , in every discussion , it does not go beyond the Convention , but it goes back"
15930,they are making simple things that were regulated simply in the draft Constitution complicated again and
15931,but I think the issue with the stairs is more serious .
15932,I also got stuck in the elevator a few times .
15933,I am active enough to walk down from the sixth or seventh floor .
15934,only all the stairs there are completely black .
15935,I have seen colleagues who were clinging to the railing in fear because they did
15936,"we need safety zones , because this can be very dangerous ."
15937,there may be falls .
15938,I am very pleased that the European side has been very clear and clear on human rights .
15939,"but we have to talk again in peace about the consequences , about what this means ."
15940,"I think that was a very good political statement , but we still have a number of problems in"
15941,"I hope that with the digital tachograph from 2004 onwards , black sheep"
15942,"I also thank our rapporteur , Mrs Breyer , for her efforts ."
15943,"the most important thing , however , is that in all the chatter about the division of power"
15944,we had set 2005 as the target date for an integrated internal market for
15945,time is running out and the competing markets and economies are not sleeping .
15946,"one can make hypothetical considerations about whether a determined , unified EU policy on"
15947,"now , on the eve of Marseilles , it is a matter of ensuring that Balkan"
15948,"under these conditions , it should be possible to reach an agreement at the special Council in Marseille ,"
15949,"we do not believe that this is the case , however , because the 35 % that"
15950,"when it is said that equal status should be achieved by 2013,"
15951,if we had had the 45 % modulation that was envisaged in the last
15952,it wouldn 't be that big .
15953,we therefore expect the Commission to make proposals in the near future that are in the direction
15954,we also believe that the proposal to grant direct payments in the semi-subsistence sector
15955,this would have included 5-6-ha farms in the full compensation payment .
15956,this would be about 50 % of the farms in Poland .
15957,"so , here too , the gradation , the social component , is included ."
15958,we see that there is room for manoeuvre here .
15959,"on the second point , following the public tender procedure published in the Official Journal , the Commission -"

16121,that is my answer to the very basic question that was asked here .

16321,can you confirm that there is no EU legislation on GMOs in contained use ?

16340,"I am rather of the opinion that the way of authorising and of competence , as"

16353,"I would like to make a few comments , namely on those areas where there are perhaps"

16355,"however , since these matters fall within the Commission 's competence , the Commission cannot accept that"
16356,what will the impact of the mid-term review be on the agricultural sector ?
16357,this frequently asked question has been addressed by the Commission in its Communication entitled :
16358,“ Towards sustainable agriculture - An interim review of the common agricultural policy
16359,"these focused on the benefits for farmers , consumers , taxpayers , citizens ,"
16360,"with these efforts , the rapporteur has done everything in his power to produce a proper report on"
16361,"I very much hope that we can avoid the risk of a third reading , Mr Deprez ."
16362,"first of all , my congratulations !"
16363,the Hautala report is an important contribution to gender equality .

16365,the screening process has thus been completed with all the candidates .
16366,but there was a misunderstanding in your question .
16367,"screening does not mean negotiating , screening is a pure comparison ."
16368,"this screening only establishes what is the acquis communautaire of the European Union , what of"
16369,that 's done .
16370,"it is quite clear that non-attached Members must not be discriminated against , but"
16371,rule 30 of our Rules of Procedure states explicitly that Members
16372,"that is the legal situation now following the judgment of the Court of First Instance ,"
16373,"when transporting animals , we are right to demand breaks to feed and water the animals ."
16374,"in the future , we will also have to think about how we can minimize the stress of"
16375,slaughterhouse transporters equipped in such a way that animals can remain on the transporters
16376,I would also like to add that our group is essentially on the side of the Commission when
16377,that does not preclude the possibility of differing opinions on detailed issues
16378,"finally , if it is again argued that the Kosovo war has shown that the EU"
16379,military is the home game of the USA .
16380,my group has views on at least three issues which are fundamentally contrary to the current dominant
16381,another challenge we face is that we also have to bring transparency into this Parliament - admitted
16382,"we are taking on this responsibility , this task ."
16383,not because we are afraid that we will be driven now .
16384,"no , we want the public to know that we have nothing to hide here !"
16385,"we are trying to get a serious basis for what we are doing here , namely the financi"
16386,"it is not possible to say that there should be a corresponding development at European level , but"
16387,this must be clearly visible so that the public knows where the money is going .
16388,we will do everything we can to make progress on this point and to introduce greater transparency
16389,because then it must be !
16390,"we must , however , avoid being criticised for any procedural issues or for the fact that"
16391,"transparency is needed here and , as we said last year in the context of the budget"
16392,the White Paper on Commission reform presented by Mr Kinnock will also be examined in this
16393,Mrs Stauner 's report lists our short-term demands for such consequences
16394,the committee debated this at several meetings and finally voted in favour with one vote
16395,"here , the rapporteur deserves particular thanks for her honesty on the one hand ,"
16396,"one of the most important objectives that the Commission must achieve , in our view , is"
16397,"I recognise that you , Mrs Schreyer , have presented an action plan ."
16398,"yet , for five years , the error rate has remained the same high ."
16399,we will have to debate this .
16400,now it is said occasionally that the legal basis of Article 152 is not suffi
16401,I have spoken with many lawyers and my assessment is that the legal basis for the
16402,unlike the issue of anonymity or the reconstruction of the body – issues which the Commission
16403,it cannot be that the poorest countries of the world are the most exposed to specula
16404,I do not think that this is impractical either .
16405,"why should it not be possible to reach an agreement between the G7 countries , the other EU"
16406,there should be a general economic interest .
16407,why should it not be practicable - and it is differentiable - to include in this tax
16408,why should it not be practicable to set the level of this tax so that the rate does
16409,"there will certainly be a great many difficult questions , but the only major problem I see is"
16410,"I also support the rapporteur 's proposal regarding 'split ' comitology ,"
16411,I would like to raise a problem which I hope is not only mine .
16412,that is the small number of exits and entrances to this Chamber .
16413,you know the behaviour of Members of Parliament very well .
16414,we usually leave the room together or enter it together before the votes .
16415,there are always traffic jams in the corridors .
16416,this is because two entrances and exits are simply too few for the large number of Member
16417,I do not know whether it is technically possible to open one of these privileged accesses
16418,"as the European Parliament , we aim to integrate Schengen and the Schengen Information System as a"
16419,this is the only way to ensure proper parliamentary control .
16420,"as a step forward in this direction , I therefore expressly welcome the fact that the development"
16421,"unfortunately , however , the initiative forgets to submit the Commission 's semi"
16422,it is hardly understandable that the European Community budgetary procedure should be used to finance Schengen
16423,"despite all the agreement on the direction of the content , there is still considerable room for"
16424,"otherwise , I can only fully support the whole of the proposals ."
16425,I apologize if I have to leave in about 15 minutes - this also concern
16426,we also have to take part in voting there .
16427,"in that respect , this is not disrespectful to the House !"
16428,"secondly , we have seen in recent weeks , firstly as a result of a huge"
16429,"it is not enough to provide aid only in the emergency situation , which , thank God ,"
16430,"no , it is not enough to help when something has happened , we must prevent it ."
16431,"we need to work together on early warning systems , on research into environmental change , so that we"
16432,I believe that the European Union has an increasingly urgent need to maintain good contacts with the public
16433,the WTO example has shown that European broadcasters could have been represented much more
16434,I would therefore be interested to know whether it would also be possible to invite journalists from
16435,"we need more , however , and that is why both the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on"
16436,we need a positive list of permitted additives and ingredients in feed .
16437,the Commission has promised to work on it and has also announced that it will not be ready
16438,we don ’ t expect that either .
16439,we do expect the Commission to issue regular interim reports and to have a rough timetable
16440,it is unacceptable that we should soon be in a situation where the Commission has to write
16441,that is not possible !
16442,"we need a clear , unambiguous positive list , and we have both , both in the"
16443,"this clearly means a high level of control , and that is why we in both committees"
16444,"manufacturers have the duty to provide precise information on the composition of their compound feed , even"
16445,we do not want to have a huge control effort and now go everywhere for inspections
16446,"if we were to do that , if we were to implement this quickly and also go through the"
16447,next year will also be important because the emphasis will be on the balanced participation
16448,"we are trying to achieve tangible results in all areas here , too : better representation of"
16449,your report is a very valuable help in this regard .
16450,the planning and implementation should be oriented to defined quality standards and allow internal bench
16451,each committee will then undertake an annual assessment of its activities and results in the field
16452,we propose that the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities then combine
16453,"a further package of measures must be taken , including those aimed at reconciling work"
16454,"using gender-neutral language , for example , is an important goal ."
16455,"secondly , international fisheries agreements are intended to exploit non-European water"
16456,I am not speaking the word protectionism .
16457,"but without public support , these agreements would be inconceivable ."
16458,we must look beyond the edge of total liberalisation in order to safeguard the many jobs
16459,I believe that the final result should be a regulation which promotes the integration of the Latin
16460,"moreover , and this is what I would like to say in general about our policy towards Latin"
16461,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by saying that the European"
16462,"I am pleased that you , Mr Jové Peres , have received the Commission proposal so positive"
16463,your report shows that we are in fact very much in agreement on this matter .
16464,the Community 's financial participation in the Member States ' control expenditure has so far
16465,"however , since we still have many shortcomings to remedy , especially in the area of"
16466,"however , the new measure must be adapted to current circumstances , as you also call"
16467,"however , the Commission is working on a proposal , within the framework of the general labelling"
16468,this proposal would then be another important step towards greater transparency in meat products .
16469,"when our resolution says that concern is widespread , it is right ."
16470,"I also note , however , that some people are wrongly fuelling this concern in order to"
16471,there are still divergences of opinion in this House as to the appropriate level of
16472,"our proposal on the Commission 's part is carefully balanced , and I would remind"
16473,"that is why I would ask , on behalf of the Commission , but also in particular on"
16474,this includes increasing the application of the rules of the European internal market in this area .
16475,"there are exceptions here that are sensible , but these exceptions are being used too extensivel"
16476,"if 15 different nations are to work together , then a certain standardisation in this"
16477,we have developed standardisation procedures in the civil sector which can also be useful in this context
16478,"at the same time , I would like to ask the Presidency of the Council to give the"
16479,this is a really powerful way to move forward .
16480,massive extension of the authorisation procedure would run strictly counter to the common objective of
16481,"that is why the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy is following a line"
16482,my party will be a guarantor that my country will remain on the European political course and
16483,"firstly , the error rate of more than 5 % , which the Court of Auditors has"
16484,"secondly , the particularly striking cases of fraud and irregularities in connection with Flé"
16485,"thirdly , Parliament must be granted unhindered access to information and documents for its control"
16486,"fourthly , the relevant disciplinary procedures must be reported on and fundamental reform must be"
16487,the haste is all the more suspicious because the proposed bundle of the local
16488,CHF 480 per month do not cover the costs .
16489,it is to be assumed that the established operators will have to hand over the connection line
16490,"in the short term , they will probably even lure with free calls , which of course will"
16491,it is therefore important to clarify once again the basic positions on the adjustment of
16492,"in the meantime , the Council at its Brussels summit also adopted parts of Parliament"
16493,we are in favour of the permanent classification and promotion of electronic commerce within the frame
16494,the Uruguay Round decisions on public procurement must be applied .
16495,"in the long term , a large number of bilateral investment protection agreements must be replaced by"
16496,"finally , we want a strong , capable and democratic Europe ."
16497,"Mr President of the Commission , let us work together on this ."
16498,we are on your side when you strengthen the Community institutions .
16499,"we call on the Council not to refuse , but to make its contribution to this project"
16500,"if we do this together , we should succeed ."
16501,"but the Council must now do its part , after the Commission and Parliament have taken the lead ."
16502,"I suspect that the ruling parties feel victorious , especially after the vote on what I"
16503,I am not sure how the register will be designed in the future and how access will actually be
16504,a wise colleague said in a discussion today that there are two methods of making people
16505,"both are bad , we do not want both ."
16506,"we therefore call for a register that is structured , that is legible and that then"
16507,"what citizens expect from the European Union is peace , security and stability ."
16508,"we , as the European Parliament , must play our part in ensuring that the European Union"
16509,"for me , this whole mess is also one more example of the fact that we immediately"
16510,I am very grateful that the Bureau has found a solution for reimbursement of expens
16511,that was very helpful and it brings us a step forward .
16512,"in general , I am very grateful to you , Mr President , for having worked on"
16513,I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my colleague Mr Lehne of the
16514,I would like to make one final point .
16515,there are two other motions concerning the Irish architects .
16516,"the PPE Group , my group , will withdraw its motion in this regard ."
16517,"I recommend that the UEN motion , which also goes in this direction , be rejected"
16518,"this is a national problem which must be solved nationally , which will be solved national"
16519,"if we introduce regulations here , it will certainly be the case that others , who are"
16520,"it is therefore unacceptable that Parliament should give , so to speak , carte blanche"
16521,Parliament must retain its sovereignty in this area .
16522,"I therefore believe that we must ensure that , when we re-establish ourselves"
16523,that was not the case at the beginning of this parliamentary term .
16524,"secondly , in a unique act of force , we brought criminal misconduct to justice during"
16525,we have ensured that OLAF is given the structure and the means to investigate every su
16526,"we want to put our trust in the judiciary , OLAF and the disciplinary measures"
16527,my group therefore supports an independent policy on Turkey below accession .
16528,"we want these high-level relations with Turkey for security , economic and political reasons ."
16529,but we also want to deepen Europe further and not allow it to be hollowed out
16530,"secondly , education – as this example shows – is not an end in itself , but rather"
16531,education policy is therefore the key to the success of economic policy .
16532,education policy is the prerequisite for today 's young people to be able to compete
16533,"this control covers a very wide range of areas , because the EU budget is large - EUR"
16534,we are confident that enlargement negotiations can be successfully concluded on the basis
16535,in our proposals we will strictly respect the budgetary ceilings of Agenda 20
16536,"we will therefore not make any proposals that go beyond this , and we will not make"
16537,"chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy ."
16538,"Mr President , the Commission and the Council have requested urgency ."
16539,this is an urgent matter so that the necessary aid can be provided quickly .
16540,"the committee already voted on the report yesterday , so we can recommend urgency ."
16541,"if you look at the schedules , you also know that they lead to impossible work situations"
16542,we increasingly receive documents at the last second .
16543,that can 't be the case .
16544,"we want to make rapid progress , but that must be accompanied by quality ."
16545,I hope that our motion for a resolution will receive your support and that the Council and the
16546,one important point is the question of when the compulsory origin marking must be introduced
16547,since the obligation to enter the place of birth and all farming sites in the animal passport
16548,"according to our calculations , this problem will still affect almost half of the beef produced from"
16549,"in this connection , I would also like to note that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has"
16550,we have provided two ideas .
16551,"we said : if weighting is to be made , then do not do it with rotation"
16552,we have also said :
16553,"in the long run , you should really make nails with heads ."
16554,"if , in a few years ' time , confidence in the euro has grown to this"
16555,"the principle is to divide business and decisions into a part of operational , short-term"
16556,"in that case , short-term decisions could also be taken by the central bank directors"
16557,we welcome the progress made by the accession countries in the harmonisation of European law and
16558,"I personally , I must say , was particularly impressed by the successes of Hungary"
16559,"however , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in particular is aware that it is"
16560,they must also be implemented .
16561,"European Community law is not just law in the books , it must also be law in action in"
16562,"for example , in the area of the precautionary principle , we need to have a clear"
16563,this precautionary principle must be legally binding in the WTO rules .
16564,"first problem : every year , the media view the refusal of the DAS as an indica"
16565,"at the same time , however , both the Court of Auditors and the Council of Ministers"
16566,I think that there must be a change and clarification of the basics of what we are
16567,"otherwise , we will be in a situation where we will , so to speak , regularly"
16568,"it is not the case in other technical sectors either : if a car accident happens ,"
16569,"however , I will not use the scheme myself ."
16570,I have started the activity under the previous conditions and will keep them for myself .
16571,"however , this list of allergenic substances must be constantly checked so that current scientific"
16572,"in this regard , together with the European Food Safety Authority , together with the Commission and the European"
16573,"for me , this means that new substances must be included , but it must also be possible"
16574,I therefore ask for support for my amendment on the permanent monitoring of the list .
16575,"Mr President , I believe that the main issue is – and this has also become clear from the"
16576,Risking equity capital is a very risky activity .
16577,"therefore , a loss carry-over and a loss offset would be of considerable"
16578,"I would also like to say , however , that enlargement is not the work of a few"
16579,on the contrary – and this is the most important thing for me – it shows that the
16580,it is not that the Community method does not work when it comes to major and important international issues
16581,"I would also like to raise two points , however , which remain very important for the European"
16582,"on the one hand , this means helping to shape an active , efficient foreign security"
16583,"we know that this also requires the use of NATO resources , if any , and Turkey is"
16584,Turkey must know that this is harming it .
16585,"again , we should think about this , and I am particularly grateful to Mr"
16586,"we have enough time until second reading to think about it , and perhaps we will be able"

16593,"but we have to admit that after this triumph , things don ’ t work anymore"

16604,an objective and comprehensive examination must include the advantages and disadvantages
16605,I see that the UN and civil society are now getting involved in these issues .
16606,"but we , the legislature , are not sufficiently involved in this area ."
16607,"Mr President , the European Parliament has been and is the driving force behind the implementation of"
16608,we have considered the fourth action programme on equal opportunities as a consequence of this .
16609,we have tried to anchor gender mainstreaming in all areas of policy .
16610,"we have launched specific measures , for example , to combat violence against women ."
16611,my group supports the proposal and the compromise amendments because we have played an active

16618,the Commission is of course taking up this concern of Parliament .
16619,I can therefore only emphasise once again that we have developed a very precise procedure
16620,"only if they are able to do so will sampling , the selection which is often controlled"
16621,"of course , this is a security that must be present ."
16622,I would therefore like to say right from the start that the most important building block for complet

16624,the successful conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice in December will pave the way

16627,"there are technical problems , but you can also solve these problems technically without using energy ."
16628,"there are new innovative approaches to reduce idle losses to almost zero , you just"
16629,"technically , this is no longer a problem ."
16630,that is why it is good that we are discussing the Energy Star here and awarding a

16632,I would also like to say that I ask that Amendment No 6 be rejected
16633,"all the more important , therefore , is that Parliament should be given full powers of code"
16634,we as an EP did not get it .
16635,we owe it to civil society outside to demand exactly this .
16636,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
16637,I would like to thank all the honourable Members who have cooperated constructively
16638,"there are many problems , many conflicts of interest still unresolved ."
16639,cultural traditions cannot be harmonized so easily .
16640,"a compromise will not really make anyone happy , and the European Parliament is not a fairy"
16641,we are talking about a balanced common position .
16642,balance between who : between authors and public interest .
16643,"Mr President , I would just like to ask you to convey to the President of Parliament our"
16644,"in this context , I would like to make a few comments on East Timor , and then I"
16645,I believe that the reconstruction of East Timor poses a very special challenge to the international community
16646,Timor is characterised by the extent of the damage and violence and the particular political situation .
16647,we therefore want and must contribute to a comprehensive solution to this issue within the
16648,this also includes the problem of how this state is to be built and how human rights are guarantee
16649,"what is the Commission 's assessment of the situation , Commissioner ?"
16650,I didn 't quite understand you .
16651,"does she think that the Finnish Presidency , and possibly the next Portuguese Presidency ,"
16652,it is an open secret that the British Government was won over only by giving an assurance
16653,it is therefore crucial that we do everything we can to ensure that transparency is finally established
16654,"we owe it to Mr Nikitin , to the independent media , which are subject to intensified"
16655,we owe it to international aid that at least the worst could be prevented and hope
16656,but that is not a satisfactory state .
16657,"therefore , not only our help is needed , but also an open word ."
16658,"we need to speak out and offer cooperation , which does not just include cheques , but"
16659,"the most important thing is to train and support all democratic forces , all independent media , the"
16660,let me mention one more point :
16661,there is a danger – as my group ’ s chairman has already pointed out – that good

16665,these taxes are therefore always a call to industry to produce vehicles with lower fuel consumption
16666,that is exactly what we want for aircraft !
16667,so why not tax aviation fuel now at the latest ?
16668,"after all , this is also about putting an end to unequal treatment of the different mo"
16669,"well , the situation is not quite that simple ."
16670,air transport covers longer distances than any other mode of transport .
16671,"above all , it overcomes borders , including the borders of the European Union"
16672,"even without kerosene taxation , airports within the EU are already in enormous competition with"
16673,"this is mainly due to different regional night flight regulations , which affect freight traffic in"
16674,the price pressure on airlines is enormous for this reason alone .
16675,"if we were to impose taxes on aviation fuel in Europe on our own ,"
16676,we would be destroying this European market ourselves .
16677,"therefore , the taxation of kerosene can only be implemented with international consensus in"
16678,"Europe must work towards this , even though it will be a difficult and long road ."
16679,"until then , however , there are certainly other ways of regulating , for example ,"
16680,"this would affect all airlines , European and non-European ."
16681,it would be neutral to competition .
16682,"we call on Russia to finally sign and ratify the border agreement with Estonia and Latvia , and"
16683,we call on Russia to finally draw the necessary conclusions .
16684,"I would like to begin by saying a few words about the financial regulation for Cyprus and Malta ,"
16685,"I am extremely grateful to Mr Brok , the rapporteur and Chairman of the"
16686,we need this instrument .
16687,it replaces the financial protocols which expired at the end of 1999
16688,we need these instruments to meet our financial commitments under the pre-accession strategy for Malta
16689,I have the impression that we are always only dealing with events in Latin America on a case
16690,"that is a pity , because the continent deserves more attention ."
16691,"the Union has pledged itself to its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam , and"
16692,"however , these values only gain their full significance if they are part of the Treaty"
16693,Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough in any case .
16694,"in this sense , the Commission must insist - and I would like to confirm and emphasise"
16695,"in this sense , the Commission must insist on the continuous development of the common area of freedom"
16696,"it is somewhat strange that the European Union has two important objectives , one in"
16697,that is why I believe that the most urgent task is to create the conditions for an area of
16698,"today , however , we are talking about Community financial aid for comparative examinations ."
16699,I support the Commission 's proposal to create a clear legal basis for this financial assistance .
16700,the budgets of the national states must be saned primarily by reducing bureaucracy
16701,I would like to thank the members of the committee .
16702,"we did not always agree , but the climate was humanly perfectly fine , and the c"
16703,this is not always the case in this House either .
16704,thank you very much !
16705,"I would like to thank the secretariat , its head , the other staff and the many people"
16706,some of them are mentioned in the report .
16707,there are others who are not mentioned in their own interest .
16708,the thanks are no less heartfelt !

16720,"we have taken a right and important step , but further steps are needed , and I am there"
16721,"only last week , it was shown how computers and the Internet are actually used in class"
16722,the Commission has been working in recent years to improve the legislation in this area substantially .
16723,I should like to mention that new legislation on the customs transit procedure came into force in
16724,they allow for better monitoring of transit operations and the handling of collateral provided to secure these
16725,the Community Customs Code has just been amended and the amendment has now been put

16738,I miss the key protagonists who were against Friday at noon today on Thursday .

16755,the path we have taken together in the past has been a good path for citizens as users of
16756,allow me to make two comments :
16757,"firstly , it is very important that the Member States recognise that they must share the"
16758,it is unacceptable that in my country the police monitor and control every football match at the
16759,that 's not going to work !
16760,we expect the Council to come to our aid on this key point .
16761,the Commission has now announced that it will hold a conference this spring on the future of SAPARD
16762,we believe that this is urgently needed and we support it .
16763,"Mr Güde , it is very difficult to answer the question about the attitude of"
16764,I will have a talk with the new Turkish Foreign Minister later this week and after that I will

16766,they have most to gain from a political solution and from Cyprus ' accession .
16767,but they also have the most to lose if a political solution is not found .
16768,I take the opportunity of your question to make a very strong appeal to the representatives of the
16769,"ladies and gentlemen , we have talked about the fact that the Constitution must and should"
16770,I therefore appeal to the President-in-Office of the Council to ensure that the Commission
16771,"we need a Community Europe , not an intergovernmental Europe ."
16772,"the Constitution is an expression of the strengthening of the Community institutions , and I therefore ask"
16773,"for me , this means that we need a functioning internal market , which means that we must"

16776,Poland has always been the first victim of European conflicts that have been fought on its so
16777,it is not its fault that it has found its way into the European Union so late .
16778,in the face of all the problems that the adaptation of Poland to the European Union entails
16779,it cannot be measured by pure numbers such as cost-benefit accounts .
16780,our test must therefore be the central question of how the new Commission is dealing with responsibilit
16781,I think that discharge for the Development Fund is a good example of this .
16782,"our committee had confidential information about mismanagement , irregularities and even suspici"
16783,"for a long time , we received only insufficient information on our questions ."
16784,that is why the majority of the committee decided to suspend discharge in order to obtain more
16785,God knows we cannot congratulate ourselves on this dubious success in the
16786,"I would like to make two critical remarks , and I also join my group colleagues"
16787,"firstly , the issue of openness and transparency in the handling of documents and information is"
16788,we expect that the agreement set out in paragraph 13 will be strictly adhered to
16789,"Mr Rapporteur , I would also like to ask you once again to clarify"
16790,the youth of Europe have only one common future – Europe !
16791,"the second point , away from the internal to the international ."
16792,how do we want the European Union to be represented in international organisations in the future ?
16793,we have now decided in Parliament to set up this committee for NATO .
16794,what is the future for the World Trade Organisation ?
16795,there are many other areas - how does Europe intend to take a leading role in future ?
16796,allow me to make the following final remark :
16797,this is not just about individual issues of the ports .
16798,"this is about the performance of our seaports in the Union , and seaport"
16799,"making these ports more effective is our common task , and I therefore ask you to"
16800,I support the rapporteur ’ s report – and the group supports it – but I also
16801,"it is therefore very important to have the Commission promise that the question of definitions , but"
16802,I think this is particularly true with regard to the international dimension of merger processes and
16803,"that is why , Mr President-in-Office , we must work together in the coming days"
16804,"on the other hand , however , the possible level of transparency and control must also be guarantee"
16805,I believe that we will find the right starting point for this .
16806,I see a lot of good will on this issue from the French Presidency .
16807,that is why we should work on it in the next few days !
16808,"on the issue of the global health fund , which has played a major role here once again ,"
16809,this is a high percentage .
16810,the proposal we have made in the budget - and we have really considered this very carefully -
16811,"at the same time , however , we also said that if it was not sufficient to prese"
16812,"but there is no reason to believe that this money would not be enough at the moment , at"
16813,"however , it should be made clear once again that securing the seat had a high priority"
16814,I am referring to the controversial issues that have remained until the very last moment
16815,"if , on the basis of reliable evidence of the ozone-depleting effect , it"
16816,"the Union continues to have a great interest in stable development in South Africa , not only"
16817,"I believe that this additional financial restriction is difficult to bear and I hope that the Commissioner ,"
16818,now to the question raised in connection with Cape Verde .
16819,"I cannot share the view that there should be a particular problem here , because we , and above"
16820,"according to Cape Verde , we should have landed all the catch on the Cape Verde islands"
16821,"however , since there is no possibility of exporting from Cape Verde to the Union for various"
16822,there are two things .
16823,"firstly , OLAF does not suspend the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities , which"
16824,it remains the case that the national judicial authorities must request the waiver of immunity
16825,"secondly , we have made every possible arrangement to ensure the independence of the Office in its"
16826,we will intervene as a political control body if this independence is compromised .
16827,I must therefore say to the Commission at this point that I find the recent appointment of a
16828,"this is not a criticism of the person in question , whom I do not know at all"
16829,this must be reversed .
16830,we have already heard the accusation that parliaments cannot handle money .
16831,this has happened in all previous centuries .
16832,we have never heard it from a democratically elected government in relation to a democrat
16833,"this is a novelty , and an unbearable one , if you look at the"
16834,the budgetary increases that have been decided on in part – well over 8 % in

16836,"I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Florenz , on this milestone in environmental policy"
16837,"I would like to comment on two major fears : firstly , that existing collection systems"
16838,"I do not see it in the same way as Mrs Jackson , but I believe that they can"
16839,"if you have to change something after ten years , that is probably reasonable ."
16840,"Sixthly , the chairmen of the four largest political groups in the European Parliament , na"
16841,my proposal is that we should seek a solution based on French law .
16842,it makes no sense that we have a patchwork of different legal regulations in the European Union
16843,that is why I would like to ask the Commission : we have a legal regulation in France that
16844,"enable the others , including the Germans and Austrians , to find a solution that works"
16845,"now , technology is not the only decisive factor ."
16846,I was very pleased that in July you initiated infringement proceedings
16847,"that is sad , basically ."
16848,"the ten Member States should be ashamed , and if the country holding the Presidency is"
16849,"we need port state control , classification societies ."
16850,the Member States did not have to be made aware of this until after the Prestige accident .
16851,"we decided on it in the case of the Erika , and you all signed it yourself"
16852,"Commissioner , I think you have Parliament 's full support on these issues , which have already been"
16853,"the report , as adopted in committee , also provides that the main settlement services should be provided"
16854,this would lead to the forced splitting of different companies and is contrary to the approach
16855,"all these services should be available to any market player , and any European legislation should focus on"
16856,"( de ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this report and wanted to take"
16857,"we have already had this this week in the case of animal transport , and we have it again"
16858,"for years , citizens have been angry , have had to bear the consequences , and now"
16859,we have an amendment which calls for the votes of individual members of the Governing
16860,I would like to make it quite clear that my group will never vote in favour of such
16861,why ?
16862,the Central Bank Council consists of personalities who are responsible for the stability of the
16863,"that is why there was no weighting of votes , as is the case in the Council"
16864,publication of the votes could lead to national debates about the behaviour of an
16865,that would be extremely negative for both the European Central Bank and for all of us .
16866,"the European Central Bank has done a good job , it has earned the citizens ' confidence"
16867,I also feel bound by the decision taken in plenary in December 2000
16868,"this is what happened , according to the rapporteur himself ."
16869,this expansion will not only change a lot inside .
16870,"there will also be many changes on the outside , and our international role will become even more respons"
16871,I share the concern of those who say that we are perhaps not yet sufficiently prepare
16872,"Russia , Ukraine , the Caucasus states , the Middle East - they are moving closer to"
16873,the neighbourhood becomes even denser and more immediate .
16874,President Prodi has spoken about how we should do this .
16875,the economic and social consequences of the expiry of the agreement for Community fishermen are well
16876,"why then this hesitation , which ultimately plays into Morocco 's hands and pulls the"
16877,"we need clarification here , and we need it as soon as possible ."
16878,"in the interests of our fishermen in the EU , Parliament must find clear words , and"
16879,I fear that otherwise there will be a negative effect on international agreements par excellence .
16880,"this means , as Mr Posselt put it , ultimately also on Europe 's foreign policy"
16881,I therefore believe that it is urgently necessary to send a signal today and tomorrow
16882,"I also strongly urge that Parliament , represented by us MEPs , should now be"
16883,there must be no doubt about this participation !
16884,"the sectoral Councils do not really play any role in the Intergovernmental Conference ,"
16885,"in Thessaloniki , it was said that it is the heads of state and foreign ministers"
16886,"you should not allow this to happen and you should not really respect the sectoral councils ,"
16887,"technical proposals , yes , but I see that political proposals are also being made in the"
16888,this is all a change of substance .
16889,the Convention has created a good atmosphere .
16890,"the Intergovernmental Conference is spreading a bad atmosphere , and we cannot use that"
16891,"yes , this issue of financing is directly related to the issue we had before ."
16892,EUR 50 million will be made available from the appropriations previously allocated to
16893,this is clearly additional money that was not available at all for other external actions before .
16894,EUR 10 million will also be made available from two budget lines where there have been implementa

16896,"secondly , we will not accept Amendment No 6 either , with which the Green"
16897,we already have speed limits on most roads in Europe .
16898,"in my country , speed limits are in place on 95 % of the road surface"
16899,where do the accidents happen ?
16900,"on 95 % of the road surfaces , because even here the speed is not suffi"
16901,"so , fewer laws and more controls , then we will have achieved more for"
16902,"as for Chechnya , Mr President-in-Office , I would just like to say"
16903,the Italian word for what is essentially happening in Chechnya is not terrorism but resistance
16904,"we must fight together for reproductive health , against AIDS and against genital mutilation ."
16905,then we have a chance to reach out to the women and help them .
16906,the Commission also agrees with the report that some issues related to the creation of a European
16907,this concerns the issue of secondary law .
16908,"in our follow-up report , we announced that we would like to go into greater detail"
16909,we were also aware that we can only manage the last pillar of immigration reasonably
16910,I repeat my offer to the Committee on Budgetary Control to inform you as soon as possible
16911,why are we dealing with this issue ?
16912,"because some Member States , especially Germany , have called into question the competence of the EU Commission"
16913,the concern of states and local authorities that competition law will massively reduce their competences and
16914,our colleague Thomas Mann has invested a great deal of work in a report on
16915,his report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
16916,"( de ) Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report ."
16917,"we propose that we change the title , also in view of the discussion that has now taken place"
16918,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by saying that :"
16919,"the report aims to use aid to shift freight transport from roads to rail ,"
16920,"I find this to be a concern in principle , because on the one hand , of course ,"
16921,"secondly , we are in a situation where aid is guaranteed to have a steering"
16922,I find this to be a fundamental concern .
16923,"I also wonder why , ten years after we liberalised the transport markets , we are now"
16924,"in principle , this cannot be positive for the future of the transport market ."
16925,"above all , we must make it clear to the Member States of the European Union that achi"
16926,"of course , I would have preferred to have binding targets , but we must now do"
16927,"so far , so good ."
16928,but where are the problem points ?
16929,where are the differences with the Council ?
16930,"given the limited time available to us all here , I will mention only two ."
16931,"firstly , the way in which the Council wants to finance the policies on which there"
16932,"as we in Parliament made clear last year , we believe that a multiannual review of Category"
16933,the Council rejects this revision of the financial perspective outright .
16934,he obviously prefers to live from hand to mouth .
16935,no revision !
16936,that is the headline .
16937,"I think he has made this a principle , because otherwise it would be impossible to understand why"
16938,they would belong there logically and in terms of content .
16939,"but he does not want a revision , even if it does not involve a financial change ."
16940,we as Parliament are now facing an extremely difficult decision-making process for Category 4
16941,"Mr President , I share the criticisms and fears that have been expressed , such"
16942,"with all due respect , Commissioner , there are still many ways to go between confidentiality"
16943,this is a criticism of the Member States and also of the Commission .
16944,"ladies and gentlemen , it can no longer be the case - we have been negoti"
16945,it must now be clear at last what the Council wants .
16946,"if we know what the Council wants , we will also be able to arrive at a reason"
16947,"in its proposal for a directive on the right to reunification , the Commission rightly"
16948,we also know and appreciate that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international conventions recognize

17343,that is the introduction to my report .
17344,I would now like to highlight an important aspect of Mr Paasilinna 's report .

17346,"instead , they will simply draw up drafts , which the Commission will examine within one month"
17347,"in the event of a refusal , the Commission may require the regulatory authorities concerned"
17348,"the European Parliament is now called upon to take a position on this complex , difficult and partly"
17349,it is only thanks to the tremendous efforts of Mrs Cederschiöld and the European Parliament
17350,I think that we should also include in this consideration the idea of working towards a European law

17352,"I believe that this would also be a kind of soft harmonisation , the initiation"
17353,I am generally very much in agreement with the Commission 's proposal to improve the safety of driver
17354,I also agree in principle that it should be compulsory to wear seat belts at all

17363,"as a result of this report , we draw the Commission 's attention to the need to improve"
17364,"however , in the debate between the Court of Auditors and the Commission , the question remains"
17365,the current Commission is of the opinion that this right exists .

17375,Japan and the US are far superior to us in both areas .

17378,this is because it links the way in which the southern countries and the southern products are treated
17379,"Madam Member , I can assure you that the reforms planned in the sectors mentioned"
17380,the timetable provided for here is in fact the result of the commitments made by the Commission
17381,they also stem from the need for us to ensure the effectiveness of the common agricultural

17398,"in the case of Cyprus , the draft regulation also provides for the financing of measures"
17399,"there is another thing , however , which I would like to mention briefly , namely the"
17400,"there is consideration for this , probably also within the Commission ."
17401,"in Berlin , a study has now been carried out by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to look"
17402,I personally would be very cautious about privatizing water .
17403,"I know that there is experience in the UK , but at least that would be an issue that"
17404,it would raise problems that would also be far-reaching in the constitutions of our
17405,to give a small example :
17406,"in Germany we have about 4000 municipal water companies , in France we have"
17407,"once this is privatised , it means that small companies are simply being bought up ,"
17408,that is something we certainly do not want .
17409,"I do not want to go into this now , and I do not have time to do so"
17410,should a consumer not have to seek his rights in the courts of the country where the
17411,which law applies ?
17412,I do not want to go back to the pros and cons of these issues today .
17413,they are well known .
17414,the Commission held a hearing on this in November .
17415,"I would just like to draw attention today to the fact that , in my opinion , the discussion"
17416,it also contradicts the strategy as formulated by the Commission itself in its communication on a
17417,but there was a part of the Convention ’ s work where consensus was no longer sought
17418,"I am talking about the question of the composition of the Commission and the result , to which"
17419,a Commission in which not all Member States are always fully and equally represented would los

17421,the Council would then move away from the current balance of power to the heights of power .
17422,that cannot and must not happen .

17424,I believe that we must use this issue to prepare for 2004 by asking
17425,what activities can the more than 600 000 sports clubs offer these

17427,all this also underlines the need for it to be anchored in the Treaty .

17433,I would strongly advise the Commission to produce a solid report so that we do not have to
17434,we also need to ensure that more languages are taught and learned in higher education .
17435,we need to ensure that there are more joint conclusions .
17436,"the example of a Franco-German university in Germany , where you can obtain joint degrees ,"
17437,we should be judged by whether we are moving this forward .
17438,"I think the university label proposed by Mrs de Sarnez is excellent , and that is why"
17439,"however , I would like to say something to the other side of the House as regards the"
17440,we will not accept any delay in the installation of the Commission .
17441,"you may push this through here if you find a majority for it , Mr Poettering , but"
17442,my group does not support this obvious delaying tactic .
17443,"secondly , the consumer aid abolished at the end of 1998 show"
17444,"records , debtor books , did not have to be kept ."
17445,"as a consequence , there has been a fairly high level of irregularities and fraud ."
17446,"in the case of the recovery of amounts paid incorrectly , EUR 42"
17447,only 6 % has been recovered so far .
17448,one must think of the restructuring of financial control and recovery in connection with the reform of

17450,"as a specific aspect , where we as the EU are also putting a lot of money into"
17451,the whole area has already cost a head of government three times his office there .
17452,"unfortunately , the approach of including air traffic in the logic of optimising overall traffic was"
17453,"I find this a pity , and we should nevertheless keep this in mind in future"
17454,I hope that the report will receive the same large majority in plenary tomorrow as it did

17460,"I have learned in the meantime , in eleven years in this European Parliament , that"
17461,that is the way it is .
17462,we have moved forward at a snail ’ s pace .
17463,that is good as long as we move forward .
17464,"I have nothing against that , but I would like to move a little faster now , because"

17471,we have monetary union .
17472,a pure regionalisation or even provincialisation of social policy cannot be the answer .

17479,"because , if we consider that the Council is persisting in its current practice , it is not"
17480,this is an unsustainable situation and we demand that it be changed !

17482,"however , if you take a closer look at these guidelines , you will find that they"
17483,it is quite conceivable that there is a contractual structure concluded between a consumer and

17489,"if this directive and this system are introduced , I believe that we as Parliament must also"
17490,"that is why , Mr Bouwman , I cannot agree with your Amendment No"
17491,we as Parliament should not pretend in 2002 that we already know the right test
17492,another lesson we need to understand : there is constant reference to alternative production .
17493,"organic farms are a good thing in my view , but they are not a panacea ,"
17494,I believe that the amendments could be accepted literally – I do not want to repe
17495,"but as for the problem itself , this event also shows us how difficult we have it ."
17496,"I can only appeal to Turkey , as my colleague Daniel Cohn-Bendit has"
17497,it is possible to get some people to stop their actions if Turkey showed accommodation
17498,I hope that Turkey will finally take these efforts seriously and come to our aid and stop
17499,and that is what is damaging Turkey ’ s image the most .
17500,"( de ) Mr President , I have learned that it is useful to combine praise"
17501,"that is why I will start by praising you , Commissioner ."
17502,it is good that we are finally having a very early and timely debate on strategic planning and
17503,"I am taking these two institutions specifically , because the Council is not important to me ."
17504,in Barcelona we saw that the Council decides its own agenda and does what it wants and
17505,"that is why the dialogue between you , Commissioner , as the representative of the Commission , and"
17506,internal security is an important issue in the context of enlargement from the point of view of

17510,I expect the Green Paper to initiate a broad and unbiased discussion on the
17511,"I would like to ask the European Parliament , as the driving force behind this idea , to"
17512,we need as much feedback as possible on our proposal .
17513,"in this context , I would like to draw attention to the market shares of the various toba"
17514,cigarettes have a share of about 91 % .
17515,"9 % is for pipe tobacco , cigars and snuff tobacco ."
17516,these products are produced in small and medium-sized enterprises .
17517,some tobacco varieties are an expression of the cultural peculiarities of the respective regions
17518,"snuff tobacco , for example , is an essential part of Bavarian culture and"
17519,"for over 400 years , snuff has been considered the most environmentally and health"
17520,it is precisely with regard to the latter that the Commission notes in its explanatory
17521,Snus is therefore the most harmless of all tobacco products .
17522,this is clearly scientifically proven .
17523,"in this respect , the use of a warning label , as proposed in Amendments Nos"
17524,"for this reason , I ask you to vote against Amendments Nos 48 and"
17525,"if you look at a petrol station in a large marina , you will see the amounts of"

17528,there is no major exchange .
17529,"especially on lakes , the boat density is often particularly high ."
17530,I can only say one thing : anyone who is good at rail must ensure that the ra
17531,fisheries must be able to stand on its own feet .
17532,"this may in some cases lead to a reduction in the status quo , but when regions are"
17533,"perhaps the most effective way to help is to give young people , in particular , a future"
17534,as a sign of confidence - and I believe a justified sign of confidence - in

17536,the resolution of the Committee on Agriculture calls for funds to be made available to compensate European agricul

17541,they raise problems and ultimately oppose further integration in their proposals for solutions .
17542,I am referring here again to the Europol Convention .
17543,"we need faster decisions , we need majority decisions in the Council ."
17544,"these initiatives also cause us problems when new institutions are constantly being created , which means more"

17569,I would therefore ask you to check this and to tell us what the outcome of this

17571,"as regards your observation on Romania , I can only say that the pleasing political and"
17572,then I come to the third motivation point .
17573,Parliament has a primary interest in us producing legible texts .
17574,I have already hinted that I am a lawyer .
17575,"when I read this story , I must say that I fell from one disaster to another ."
17576,what we are producing here is basically data junk for the interested public .
17577,we must produce consolidated texts more quickly in future .
17578,"Parliament adopted eleven amendments from this set of reasons by a large majority ,"
17579,"if there are new recommendations from the scientific community , we are of course happy to examine them"
17580,"as far as control is concerned , I agree with those who have called for the level of"

17608,"it is intended to make life easier not only for national authorities but also ,"
17609,the most important benefit for farmers is probably that they will have to fill out fewer form
17610,"for national authorities , this will reduce both the workload of processing applications and the workload"
17611,"secondly , the ecopoint system as such is not attacked by the Commission 's proposal"
17612,the target of a 60 % reduction has been maintained .
17613,the Commission is explicitly in favour of continuing the ecopoint system .
17614,only the so-called 108 % rule is to be deleted .
17615,"this rule runs counter to the actual objective of the ecopoint system , namely to"

17617,the 108 % clause sets a ceiling for transit journeys and provides for penal

17624,"the communication that the Commission has presented states , in a very pertinent way , that we call"
17625,it does not say exactly where the priorities are and under what conditions this should happen .
17626,"I would like to reiterate Parliament 's constant demand that we should state clearly ,"

17637,I welcome the rapporteur 's decision to adopt a five-year period of validity ;
17638,my group shares this view .
17639,programmes to improve the production and marketing of honey are regularly submitted for approval by

17641,"the Council has already adopted a common position , which it told me yesterday that it could"
17642,"of course , that is not how it works !"
17643,"if we were to vote on this report today , we would end up in a situation where the"
17644,that will not happen today !
17645,"we will ask the Commission to stand by us , in accordance with the five points adopted"
17646,"in this context , Mr President-in-Office , I also believe that we should make our"
17647,"we should try to do our part there , too ."
17648,the Commission therefore maintains its conclusion in the communication that NAFO is an exception to the

17650,"in addition , the Commission also has a lot of work to do in relation to negotiations"
17651,I also have concerns that the Lamfalussy / Wogau procedure was always intended only
17652,"the end product , the end result , must be seen as equality between the European Parliament and"
17653,and we have not yet achieved this end result .
17654,we therefore welcome the amendments tabled by Mr von Wogau to the Bourlang
17655,we support the resolution of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
17656,"we expect the Commission to include this point in the list of demands to the Convention , in"

17673,the Management Committee has also supported this proposal by a majority .
17674,this will also make it possible to fulfil all contracts concluded in the Member States .

17681,we want a consensus on this issue .
17682,we would also do well to seek the broadest possible consensus on this issue here in Parliament
17683,"as the permanent rapporteur for the agencies , I can say at this point that the"
17684,we have made a de facto decision to look at the agencies individually .
17685,I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a few things for the future :
17686,"secondly , the previous internal market directives have essentially led to an asymmetrical"
17687,"they have certainly brought greater competitiveness , efficiency gains and price reductions , but"
17688,"this means that equal conditions for all market participants must be ensured , the risk of market"

17690,"after Copenhagen , when the public has realised that we are serious about the first step with"
17691,we can only be credible in this regard if we say that further enlargement of the European

17693,"I therefore found the behaviour of the current American administration all the more regrettable ,"
17694,"I believe that this must be said quite clearly , especially when we consider how the European Union"
17695,"unfortunately , only half of this has been achieved , mainly because the largest industrial"
17696,"the EU has been the engine , pointing the finger in the right direction , especially in the"
17697,the same applies to the lump sum cost scheme .
17698,"in future , reimbursement of any costs must only correspond to actual expenditure and the"
17699,a transparent and comprehensible regulation of travel costs is essential .

17782,"Commissioner , you have referred to renewable energy ."
17783,this is less about subsidies and the like than about the question of when we will have a

17785,"this is also because people believe that when the steel aid code expires , they can do"
17786,"we therefore demand that , after the Treaty expires , steel aid be regulated"
17787,"in its third special report on the impact on the cereal sector , the Court of Auditors"

17791,today we are facing the major enlargement of the European Union .
17792,in a few years we will see a Europe that can be an area of stability and freedom
17793,but how will we do that ?
17794,"the aim is to achieve consumer protection primarily through two instruments , namely the right of"

17842,"on the one hand , the Community must act consistently , whether it is in the area"
17843,"with the introduction of the euro , including coins and banknotes , we will be able"
17844,"it is also good that this concept of the home market is also making the euro project , which"
17845,"I am also against attempts to grant all non-EU citizens the same right to vote ,"
17846,this would be unique on the globe and would also be discriminatory against EU citizens .

17849,"nuclear family yes , but whole kinship no ."
17850,"as regards the amendments that have been tabled , I can accept the first two"
17851,"however , I do not believe that they belong in the text of the regulation , since the"
17852,"the crucial point , where there are still differences , is the question of alternative forms of"

17854,"the question of what the framework is , what the details are , what the political objective"
17855,"I must therefore insist that we , as Parliament , are always consulted on this issue at"

17857,the third point is – and I would like to contradict all those who say that this is

17859,"fourthly , the increase to EUR 300 million reflects the desire to create"

17868,"industry must be given the opportunity to implement this , if it ultimately serves to ensure that"
17869,we also believe that an advisory committee would be the right instrument .

17895,I fully agree with all these statements .
17896,"what is worrying , however , is the means by which the Commission and , above all"
17897,I would like to comment on just three points .
17898,I am saying this deliberately in the context of the current discussion on labour market reform and
17899,"of course , we need flexible , adaptable systems , but we also need modern systems ."
17900,"they are modern if they also offer security , security when looking for work , security at work ,"

17908,"this development must be completed by 2006 at the latest , and that is"
17909,that was not the case in the last period .
17910,I am stressing this because I have the impression that the new programmes are once again being

17912,"we cannot afford to spend EUR 30.4 billion , as we did in"
17913,"in view of these considerations , we also support Mr Collins 's request that the Commission should"

18126,"Mr President , I wanted to refer to Rule 122 ."
18127,this is about personal remarks .
18128,it states that you can make this personal remark if there have been statements made in the debate
18129,what I am now complaining about is that no statements were made about me at all
18130,maybe I can make a personal remark anyway .
18131,I would have liked to have heard someone say that the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and
18132,no one has said that we have been working on this for years now - and I in particular
18133,I wanted to say that on a personal note .

18135,I would also like to emphasise once again that there are many things that need to be

18137,there is an old backlog of commitments that he inherited from the old Commission .
18138,there are inadequate administrative structures and staffing shortages .
18139,in the countries themselves there are problems with wars and crises - all of this we take

18160,"unfortunately , there is no time to do more ."
18161,but I thank everyone who is working for this !
18162,this means consequences in two areas in particular .
18163,anyone who wants sustainable economic growth of 3 % or more must drastically
18164,it must do so in the private sector as well as in the public sector .
18165,the Commission must make a decision here .
18166,it cannot pursue the Lisbon objectives and at the same time advocate a policy

18170,"we , on the Commission 's part , are trying to make an appropriate contribution"

18184,"this morning when I came into my office , the door was open , although I know for"
18185,I think that we must in any case examine what happened there last night .
18186,we have tabled an oral question on behalf of the committee .
18187,the main point here is that we in the committee criticised the way in which the Council decided
18188,we did not focus so much on the content – there were indeed some contradictions and
18189,this seems to us to be particularly necessary in the area of trade policy .

18415,"in the US , investments increased by 4 % in the 1990s"

18422,Mr de Miguel has already referred to Bulgaria and Romania for the Spanish Presidency .
18423,I can confirm that .
18424,both countries still need some time to meet the accession requirements .
18425,but that is precisely why they need a clear signal that the train will not have left Copenhagen

18429,that is why the code of conduct must be designed in such a way that it really stops

18439,"secondly , I believe it is necessary to be kept informed by the Commission on the"

18441,we are talking about the “ dormant means ” .
18442,"Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gent"
18443,this is a rather dry matter after this eloquent speech by the chairman of our Committee on Budget

18450,"then , Commissioner Byrne , you should have asked for these four years directly , if it is"
18451,"if the Commission still keeps the back door open for a three-year postponement ,"

18463,I therefore urge you to support Amendment No 4 .
18464,this brings me to the second topic :
18465,"I would like to make a few comments on this , not as rapporteur but as a member"
18466,"I would just like to mention , as an example , the debate on the country of origin principle"
18467,"in both cases , in both alternatives , we as legislators have been moving a little bit"
18468,"Furthermore , we may create problems which will be difficult to deal with in legal practice"
18469,"in conclusion , I would like to stress that our proposal has gained in quality thanks to Parliament"
18470,I am sure that the improvements will help save more lives in the future and reduce the damage
18471,we reaffirm that the conclusions drawn by the Stockholm European Council and the strategic object

18477,I see the restructuring of premiums as one of the most important points .
18478,the introduction of a flat-rate premium is a major step forward .
18479,"however , I would like to stress that the amount proposed by the Commission is far too low"
18480,"this premium must also be an incentive for sheep and goat farmers , and it is"
18481,"this premium must be the same for farmers , whether they produce ewes for breastfeeding"
18482,because a differentiation can not actually be justified .
18483,"at the time , the European Parliament was of the opinion that we had not been properly consult"
18484,we complained at the time .
18485,we won this case before the European Court of Justice .
18486,the relevant Council regulation was declared null and void .
18487,the result was that the Commission submitted a new proposal to us which was very similar to its
18488,"Mr President , the report before us is a step in the right direction ."
18489,but he would have to go further .
18490,"in the public opinion today , the impression of good information is often created by bringing mountains"
18491,"however , citizens do not measure information by its appearance , but by its content , transparency"
18492,it is true that transparency and publicity can help prevent such phenomena as corruption and the
18493,the latest report by the Court of Auditors shows how urgently change is needed here .
18494,"in this respect , I think that if Parliament today moves this one case to the first pil"

18497,"I think that , in this respect , the start we are making today is an important one ."
18498,"in implementing Interreg , coordination and synchronisation with the other financial instruments concerned"
18499,this is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the resources used .
18500,"however , problems arise in particular from the annuality and project-related allocation of funds"
18501,"this will cause problems in practice in the future , and I hope that it will nevertheless"
18502,small and medium-sized enterprises in particular will benefit from the easier frame

18504,"here , Mr President-in-Office , more democracy and transparency are also needed , and"
18505,"in economic policy , in particular , we see that further progress must be organised on the basis"
18506,at a time when one negative forecast about the development of the European Union chases the other

18508,"this also applies to tax policy , Mr President , because there is unfair competition within the"

18510,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very happy ."
18511,starting with the reports by my dear colleagues Mr Evans and Mr Pirker
18512,another important step forward was the ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages

18533,"I would therefore like to urge you once again , Commissioner , to respond very clearly"
18534,"we call on the Commission to make a legislative proposal before July 2003,"
18535,I think that we need very clear European legislation on this .
18536,we have been getting along well between the Member States for more than 50 years .
18537,"peace prevails between the very different societies , but in the family sphere there is often"
18538,victims are mostly children .
18539,in the newspaper we read that they are kidnapped by their parents or that they are not

18546,"I think that this is indeed a very ambiguous signal that has been sent here ,"
18547,"the European Union needs modern , efficient , operational and transparent conflict management for this purpose"
18548,only under these conditions can we count on broad support for this project among the European population .
18549,"I believe that if we succeed in giving Morocco a European orientation , then Morocco will"

18553,"so nothing that our society absolutely needs , but leisure behaviour of citizens ."
18554,"if you are not polluting the environment because it is socially necessary , but for"
18555,it is therefore right and necessary that we improve this directive on one or two points
18556,consideration is also under way of the feasibility of common standards for the protection of
18557,it is not possible to go into detail on all thirty points of the resolution .
18558,"although the Commission 's attitude to this is generally very positive , I would like to express"
18559,the resolution calls for the full application of the ne bis in idem principle .
18560,"the Commission supports this , especially since this principle is also contained in our new Charter of"
18561,"however , the Commission has serious doubts as to whether it would be wise to apply only"
18562,"Mr President , I do not want to punish anyone , but I would like to get to"
18563,it is right that the European Union has managed to introduce European rules on the issue of inci
18564,these European rules are important for the very simple reason that we have a liberalised electricity market in
18565,that is why the Commission has reacted rightly by focusing in particular on old plants
18566,I can expressly confirm that the Commission has taken action in this area .
18567,I even welcome it very much and believe that a step has been taken in the right direction .
18568,"if we are now demanding further advances in the framework of structural fund support ,"
18569,I would like to stress that we should not give the impression that the inclusion of the environmental
18570,let me point out another weak point :
18571,"it is doubtful whether the environmental impact assessment , as set out in the text before"
18572,"too often , important regulations are left to the discretion of the Member States in their application"
18573,"this certainly satisfies the regionalists in the EU , but it hardly serves to"

18575,this is where I see the crucial weakness of the compromise reached in the Concili

18577,"we must ensure that the Parliamentary Assembly takes accompanying action as soon as possible , and"

18579,we have to show them how they too can make the cake as big as possible .

18591,it is schizophrenic .
18592,we also have few opportunities to actually put pressure on them .
18593,the opportunity to exert economic pressure on Iran should not be taken away .
18594,we believe that the international community has a great responsibility to investigate and establish the situation
18595,"I would like to say to Mr Wurtz , who asked for the floor earlier , that"

18627,thank you again for that !
18628,we also know that there is intense discussion in the Council on how to structure the definition issues .
18629,there are excellent discussions about the individual definitions .
18630,we have now reached an agreement in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
18631,I have the impression that the committee 's proposals will meet with broad support tomorrow .

18639,I ask that this somewhat unusual procedure be carried out .
18640,this gives us the chance to get a new text .

18650,24 Euros per 100 Euros transfer on average is simply too much
18651,I really do reject Mr Maaten 's proposal .
18652,"all the trials have been started , we must now come to decisions ."
18653,I must also say that I do not understand Mr Karas 's admission .

18678,that too has nothing to do with the jobs .
18679,what is important is that we do something in the area of security .
18680,Mr Ferber is right in that .
18681,but there is no direct connection with the incident yesterday .
18682,the Committee welcomes in principle all the Commission 's proposals on labour immigration .
18683,I hope that the broad basis we have found in committee will also hold up here in plenary

18717,"this is also imperative , because the number of cross-border transactions is increasing in Europe"
18718,there are two very important factors :
18719,one factor will certainly be the introduction of the euro next year .
18720,another factor is modern technologies – I just refer to electronic commerce .
18721,"in the future , when you order goods and other things via electronic commerce , you will"
18722,this will inevitably lead to a growth in cross-border business .
18723,I therefore believe that it is also necessary for us to develop a broader common set
18724,the constitutional reform that has now been adopted is an important sign of this .
18725,I do see great progress in this constitutional reform .
18726,Parliament adopted these important decisions very quickly and by an overwhelming majority .
18727,I consider this large majority to be particularly important because it shows that there is clearly a

18731,this alternative is being examined by the competent authorities in Luxembourg in the coming weeks .
18732,there is therefore no reason whatsoever to maintain this derogation now .
18733,"I therefore ask you , Mrs Flemming in particular , and the members of the PPE"
18734,"this is not a developing country , it is a highly developed technology in a highly developed country"

18736,"we have private , state , semi-state , publicly controlled ports , but they"
18737,"nothing against subsidies , but then subsidies for everyone ."

18751,and that is why political reform must be an integral part of the concept .

19262,it is a right that no one in this House would allow to be taken away from them .

19333,"the Military Committee is discussing a mission to the Congo in Brussels , for example ."
19334,this cannot happen without the European Parliament 's participation .
19335,"we must be informed about it , we must be able to give our opinion on it ."
19336,"when it comes to peace and war , such matters cannot be decided without the participation of a"
19337,"as a result , we need a European Parliament opinion on this important issue , at least next week"

19350,I would like to leave it at these points .
19351,there are a number of other limits that we must respect when we vote at noon this after

19353,"if they are properly promoted , they may bring us closer to the dream of defe"
19354,I think that is where the future really lies .
19355,I am afraid that we are focusing too much on authorisation in these reports .

19357,"the rapporteur has already pointed out in her speech that , despite this fundamental affirm"
19358,"although the rapporteur is from my group and I appreciate her commitment , I would reject"
19359,"the ECB cannot table amendments here , and it is an insinuation to all"

19361,"finally , we are asking for an examination of whether the PRINCE programme can be"
19362,"however , it is not clear why MEPs are constantly maneuvering into the dilemma"
19363,it is hardly understandable that the adult citizen should be required to accept instructions on
19364,credit financing alone will not be enough ;
19365,to organise private capital alone will not be enough and is also insanely difficult .
19366,"we see in many projects that , de facto – and Commissioner Kinnock has already made proposals"
19367,"in my view , we should really consider whether there is a possibility , for example , of"
19368,"the Presidency 's proposals were very problematic in this respect , because they are too"
19369,the Commission and the Council are now called upon to finally come to decisions and to propose a
19370,"since I have the floor , there is a translation error in the Swedish version of paragraph 2"
19371,"instead of ‘ Economic and Social Committee ’ , it should be ‘ Committee"

19373,"in the area of judicial cooperation , however , we have to say that this cooperation is"
19374,"with Eurojust , we now have a new instrument which will start working in 200"
19375,Eurojust will then work in principle like Europol .
19376,it coordinates law enforcement authorities in the fight against organised crime .
19377,I have two questions .
19378,"firstly , it is not quite clear to me whether it is a flexible system of bilateral relations"
19379,that seems to me to be an important point .
19380,my second question concerns the Balkans .
19381,I know that the Balkan countries are very differentiated and some are able to join the European Union
19382,but the other countries will still need a long period of internal development .
19383,"it would therefore be wrong not to include them in such a concept , since they could also"
19384,perhaps the Commission could review this position .
19385,what has changed in Turkey ?
19386,"firstly , it is mainly on the initiative of the Greek Foreign Minister , to whom"
19387,"of course , one of the issues will be how to separate the financial compensation for fishing"
19388,"you see , we still have a lot to do ."

19393,it will be an incentive for asylum seekers if we go beyond the binding frame
19394,"there are honorable arguments for this in detail , but we cannot allow more asylum than"
19395,the problem of asylum is in the procedure .
19396,Ninety percent of all asylum seekers in our countries are still not politically persecuted
19397,we therefore need to get the procedure under control .
19398,"if we can bring the procedure to a speedy conclusion , we can be more generous with"
19399,"however , this is contradicted by , for example , a three-stage asylum procedure"
19400,I would therefore like to call on the Commission to adopt the proposals it has promised
19401,I would like to draw particular attention to the legislative proposals in the audiovisual sector
19402,there is still no proposal for the long-awaited revision of the Television without Frontiers Directi
19403,it is rather an eternal consultation process on the part of the Commission .
19404,"Mr President , I am glad to see that the report is very good ."
19405,"I would like to begin by thanking Mrs McNally , who , due to urgent commit"
19406,"as rapporteur for the specific hygiene provisions , I can only build on clear and"
19407,I emphasised this particularly because there are other ideas in the Council .
19408,I would therefore like to emphasise once again that only the basic legal regulation can apply
19409,we cannot accept anything else .
19410,"ladies and gentlemen , the latest progress report , but also your resolutions , have made"
19411,the causes of the difficulties of most candidate countries are undoubtedly rooted in their
19412,"I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report , which I fully support ."
19413,"may it not be , as before , just patient paper ."
19414,"after all , the ECB 's primary objective of ensuring price stability is"
19415,"therefore , monetary policy should not be formulated in isolation , but should be complement"
19416,here there is still a lot to be desired .
19417,"Mr President , nine million jobs today , twelve million in ten years ."
19418,"tourism is a sparkling source of jobs in Europe , but there is still a lack"
19419,there is neither far-sighted support nor a focus on small and medium-sized
19420,"as we are still far from a knowledge-based strategy , it is no wonder that there is"
19421,I have never understood the boycott of the Philoxenia programme by some Member States
19422,hence my question to Commissioner Liikanen : does he still give such a programme a chance
19423,"as regards the question of coordinating the various measures , since the beginning of 1"
19424,"a few weeks ago , the Commission also presented a proposal for an information campaign on the euro"

19426,"( de ) Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report ."
19427,the current high euro exchange rate should be a sign that the European economy is actually doing well .
19428,we all know that this is not really the case .
19429,"we are not really doing well , we have lived above our means in the last decades"
19430,"our social , pension and health systems are no longer de facto sustainable ."
19431,the consequence of this is that those who are willing and capable are burdened with tasks
19432,"if we want to solve the problem , we must relieve the burden on our service"
19433,Europe must share the burden more fairly .
19434,"in addition to reducing taxes , we must also create employment conditions that enable e"
19435,work must be worthwhile in Europe again .
19436,this is the only way we can effectively combat our economic problems in the future .
19437,"firstly , geographical neighbourhood with non-EU countries while belonging"
19438,"secondly , the relative isolation due to the great distance from Europe ."
19439,"thirdly , the small size of the local domestic market ."
19440,"fourthly , geographical and climatic conditions that are very adverse to the development"
19441,"Fifthly , economic dependence on a few products in the economy ."
19442,"Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of the Council ,"
19443,I have been watching the debate and the preparation of the resolutions for tomorrow with
19444,"I too have my personal opinion on this , but that does not help us any further !"
19445,"the EU 's vaccination policy has been increasingly in the spotlight , at the latest with"
19446,the use of conventional vaccines is associated with long periods of complete isolation of

19451,"but that is exactly what this proposal , which is quite sensible in practice , is sick"

19462,"in so doing , he has trampled on Parliament 's budgetary rights ."
19463,"at the same time , it is forcing Parliament to choose between fighting for its rights and"
19464,"by acting in this way , the Council has broken the bond of loyal cooperation ."
19465,"fourthly , I would like to express my expectation of the Commission 's mid-"
19466,"with the 2004 European Parliament elections coming up , we must prove to the citizens"
19467,"otherwise , we have also lost a piece of our own raison d ’ être ."
19468,worse in our view was the fact that the possibility of an examination without training was

19472,it has been said here that freedom of the media is being brutally and massively suppressed
19473,"we demand their release and media freedom , but we must , of course , do something practical"
19474,I welcome the fact that Mr Wiersma has taken up something that I have also included in this
19475,we therefore know how to assess the issue of death sentences being handed down or
19476,"in each individual case , we must then examine what we can do to prevent , if possible ,"
19477,this is also the case in the cases that have been mentioned here .
19478,the European Union has set clear rules for what to do when even minimum standards are not met
19479,"in such cases , the European Union must intervene ."

19520,I am pleased to have found such broad agreement on this issue in this House today .
19521,"I believe that it would be very helpful for us if Turkey realised that the Council ,"

19578,I think we must recognise that we need very clear transparency for the consumer and safe
19579,then we cannot say that we are prepared to put industry 's interests before consumer protection
19580,let me now briefly outline these seven points .
19581,"firstly , we propose to reduce the allowable density for the special premium for male ca"
19582,"secondly , we want the Member States to respect the so-called 90-"
19583,both measures will increase the incentive to produce extensively .
19584,"thirdly , in order to make organic farming more attractive , we propose that organic farmer"
19585,"fourthly , the Commission also wants to set the number of entitlements to the"
19586,this measure will also reduce the incentive to intensive production .
19587,"Fifthly , our package also provides that a higher percentage – at least 20 %"
19588,"this should also help to limit beef production , which is very dependent on the number of breast"
19589,"thirdly , we cannot stand by and watch as planes bomb the civilian population !"
19590,"I condemn these bombings , just as I condemned the bombings of Novi Sad , Bel"
19591,"license fees for shipowners have been increased considerably , from 20 euros to 2"
19592,"overall , the protocol will result in a major redistribution of costs between the Community and"
19593,this is in line with the Council decision of 1997 on third-country
19594,"there are also technical improvements in the reporting of catches , the settlement of fees due"
19595,"that is why I am all the more sorry that , on this important issue , which should be"
19596,there has been a very clear contradiction between what was wrongly claimed there this morning and
19597,our great goal with the WTO negotiations is ultimately to ensure health until old age
19598,"health has something to do with life science , with biotechnology ."
19599,"I believe that we should not be afraid to discuss this area , we should not be too"
19600,we should be clear about what is good for us and what is bad for us .
19601,"we should fight what is harmful , but we should also be clear about what is good"
19602,"economic interests are one side of the coin , consumer protection the other ."
19603,"I believe , however , that we should take the authorities ' concerns very seriously ,"
19604,I 'm curious to see the result tonight !
19605,"thirdly , in many Member States , public transport in rural areas is operated by small and"
19606,"they must not be forced out of the market without necessity , but vice versa ."
19607,I think they must also have a chance in the market when it comes to the direct allocation of
19608,"in some regions in Germany , at least , school transport accounts for almost 90 %"
19609,"I think we are all agreed that the Commission 's deadlines are too short , both"
19610,"we have different opinions on other things , and unlike Mr Schmitt , I believe that"
19611,"finally , as several Members have mentioned in the debate , I would like to draw"
19612,the Commission and the Community are in a position to mobilise 542 52
19613,I would also like to point out that during the negotiations we have maintained constant contact
19614,the Commission considers it its duty to achieve this goal as soon as possible .
19615,but we cannot do this alone .
19616,the international community must act together !
19617,it has a common interest in establishing European safety standards .
19618,the Member States and the international community will also have to help and advise the candidate countries .
19619,"increasing the safety standard of nuclear facilities , either by retrofitting or by closing"
19620,"fourthly , should not more weight be given to demand-oriented economic policy , in"
19621,"Fifthly , is it so wrong to assume that the fixing of the exchange rate at"
19622,"Sixthly , what are the specific reasons why the ECB is expected to make"
19623,especially as regards the protection of external borders and the fight against cross-border crime
19624,it is also massively supported by the police unions and associations .
19625,"you know that in the border region between the EU and the candidate countries , in other words in"
19626,but I think it is too early to make a decision on this .
19627,"of course , that would be the best location ."
19628,"but today , the first thing we need to do is to actually create this police academy ."
19629,all political forces are working together here .
19630,"I would like to thank the Bavarian and German Interior Ministers , as well as the"
19631,"I believe that this is a unique opportunity to create a concrete Europe , namely a Europe of"
19632,"I therefore hope that this paragraph 18 , which provides for the derogation from"
19633,"I would like to emphasise that our group will , as with every Presidency , be"
19634,sometimes you have no sense of symbolism .
19635,but when I see the competence of Italy represented not only here in Parliament but also in
19636,"we , the European People ’ s Party , the European Democrats , say that security on our"
19637,Parliament also attaches importance to the fact that in future it will receive a report on what is
19638,the new Commission has begun to focus on greater transparency .
19639,"this transparency is particularly important in this important field , where there is a risk that things"
19640,"the subject of ' civil transitional administration ' , the subject of ' peace agreements'"
19641,that is why today 's decision is also an important step in providing clear and unambigu
19642,the second point I would like to raise :
19643,the Commission and the Council really seem to be maximalists on the one hand and minimalists on
19644,"on the other hand , the European Union and , above all , the Council are very minimalistic"
19645,"the Commission or Parliament , or whoever is responsible , is always blamed , but never"
19646,"if they were to give the money for it the next day , we would all – but above"
19647,"as far as the bottlenecks in individual categories are concerned , I would like to"
19648,"this year , we have remained far , far below the estimates provided for in the financial"
19649,no Member State can imitate us in this way of practically exercising budgetary discipline .
19650,my request to the Commission is to ensure that the organisations and sections of the population that
19651,not that one tries to marginalize a little bit one or another organization that is just
19652,stay with the positive experiences that LEADER has shown so far .
19653,"it is sometimes a bit like cloud-pushing at the beginning , when you say it is"
19654,"and then , while working , while doing , something comes out that official politics – even we at"
19655,"that was the charm of LEADER , and we must not let it go away !"
19656,"there are two points on which the Council and Parliament are not yet entirely in agreement , and"
19657,perhaps he can say something later in the debate on the two points that are so close to
19658,"Mr President , we have just seen how , after Friday , Thursday is being tried to be de"
19659,"I would like to say , however , that the particular issue of Cambodia is proof of the"
19660,we want to see a very flexible solution .
19661,if a Member State declares that we are suddenly having problems because the person has committed
19662,"secondly , there is a lot going on in the European skies and , in the mean"
19663,"now that the single sky project has been launched into the right orbit , we encourage the Commission to"
19664,let me make a few comments on individual points .
19665,the report provides that biometric data of asylum seekers shall not be used for criminal prose
19666,anyone who agrees with this must of course ask themselves why the general level of data protection
19667,we have the highest level of data protection in Europe .
19668,why you want to prevent the effective use of Eurodac and thus the protection of our
19669,"Mr President , I have five points to answer on behalf of the Commission ."
19670,"I would therefore like to say in summary , on human rights issues , that the Commission"
19671,I would also like to thank Mrs Gröner for having put in such a great effort and for
19672,"thank you , and for all good luck !"
19673,the results are impressive .
19674,we are getting the safe double-hull tankers at a faster pace .
19675,"from 2003 , the decommissioning of the old single-hull"
19676,I think we should try to save this Friday debate and these Friday votes by urging our
19677,"secondly , it is about obliging Member States to implement a Union-wide control programme for"
19678,"thirdly , we want to introduce a rapid alert system for feed , similar to what already exist"
19679,I would point out that the deadline for this has been changed and that it is now set
19680,we also want a ban on the mixing of contaminated feedstock and a ban on the
19681,there is one Member State where there has been a debate in the parliament as to whether people over
19682,"the discussion is over again , but it was discussed ."
19683,there are laws in all Member States which simply prohibit people from working after a certain age
19684,this is discrimination on the basis of age .
19685,"please do not come to me with the big shout : "" then we will take the"
19686,this reminds me of the discussion in the 1960s about keeping us
19687,it has also been said that women must leave working life so that men have work .
19688,that was the discussion that the unions have been having for a long time .
19689,"today , you have again led the wrong discussion ."
19690,"in this context , it should be noted that the Commission has not yet presented to the"
19691,the European Commission 's proposal for a directive does not make any reference to tax regulations
19692,it is very important for us to know to what extent the existing provisions are to
19693,"Commissioner , you have announced that a communication will be published shortly ."
19694,"in order to be able to assess the whole package , it is very important for us to"
19695,all these questions are open and are closely linked to the success of the proposal for a
19696,it is of course not entirely irrelevant from a political point of view whether the chairs
19697,"it is clear , of course , that we need to provide for a procedure in the Rules"
19698,it is also clear that the results of the investigation must be implemented and that this can
19699,"on the other hand , it is also clear that the plenary cannot be completely deprived"
19700,"the Commission also attaches great importance to services of general interest , as shown in its January"
19701,"however , as you know , the maintenance and development of services of general interest is the sole responsibilit"
19702,the Commission can only give impetus in this area .
19703,"in its Communication , the Commission clarifies that the objective and purpose of services of general"
19704,"moreover , the new Article 16 of the Treaty explicitly recognises"
19705,the importance of these provisions was also emphasised by the Heads of State and Government
19706,"we are therefore very pleased , Commissioner , that you have presented this communication , and"
19707,"I assume that , by demonstrating unity in this area in Parliament together with the Commission ,"
19708,I have great hope .
19709,"in particular , I consider the following to be necessary and worthy of support :"
19710,"in order to protect consumers in the EU internal market , it is essential to harmonise maximum"
19711,harmonisation of the authorisation of plant protection products is also necessary .
19712,"until that is done , the principle of mutual recognition must be allowed in the individual"
19713,this is a requirement of equal opportunities in competition .
19714,we should see this debate in that light .
19715,"when you write in the introduction of your document that the citizens feel more distrust , more dis"
19716,"I see a problem here , precisely in this wording ."
19717,"we , Parliament and the Commission , are acting as if there were national governments and national"
19718,"this is precisely the contradiction - Member States here , European institutions there - that citizens feel"
19719,we must finally clarify :
19720,the European Union is all of us !
19721,"there is hardly any European decision without the codecision of the national governments , but there"
19722,"the issue of co-decision power creates transparency , publicity and the ability"
19723,"all this , and I will conclude , shows how many discussions we still have ahead"
19724,"the 2000 budget must be drawn up jointly over the coming months ,"
19725,"with this directive , which is the first framework of its kind in the world , the"
19726,the directive is intended to increase people 's confidence in the reliability of open
19727,"at the same time , it makes an important contribution to the free movement of goods and"
19728,"in conclusion , I would also like to say that too much praise for the Commission is not"
19729,we want to limit that a little .
19730,"I would like to draw your attention to a point , Commissioner , which I have already pointed"
19731,"this is also related to the subject of qualitative criteria , qualitative assessment and quantitat"
19732,there is one area where you rightly note that regional aid granted in the Member States
19733,you conclude that this is the area where we can achieve the best and fastest reduction
19734,"this is , however , a somewhat general approach , and I would recommend that we reflect a"
19735,"if we could have a debate on this next year , we would have come a little further ."
19736,"today , six months later , we can say that progress in these three key areas of integration"
19737,these progresses are closely linked to the double crisis that the European Union has had to
19738,"the timing of the Commission 's resignation , the outbreak of the Kosovo war and"
19739,"in this extremely difficult period , the members of the EU have not only maintained unity"
19740,they have used the crisis as a productive stimulus for further integration .
19741,the reason for this is that the Kosovo war has once again made clear what the core of European
19742,"with this insight , individual national interests became relative , and a willingness to take a"
19743,"in this sense , I can say that we , and I as a representative of the Austria"
19744,I know that your team in Brussels has the power to act reasonably in the interests
19745,"of course , we hope that we will be treated with sensitivity in matters of transit"
19746,"but we are all aware that enlargement is a tremendous opportunity , that this opportunity must be"
19747,"I would like to ask you how you intend to ensure that a method is found which ,"
19748,I believe that we must also put the right balance in the right place to reflect on what Mrs
19749,"she is absolutely right to point out that Scotland , or the United Kingdom , is making available"
19750,but this is financed entirely from national resources and declared as national aid .
19751,"in other words , no Community money is used for this , which in a sense also means an"
19752,have we reduced our consumption ?
19753,"no , no , no ."
19754,"Mr Jarzembowski , who has just spoken – he can shout loudly"
19755,we have more transport on the road than we had ten years ago .
19756,let us change that at last !
19757,let ’ s shift the transport .
19758,let us make it a reality that we are shifting transport to rail and water .
19759,let us make ourselves less dependent .
19760,"let us have a common energy policy , for example ."
19761,"you , Mrs Palacio , and we should call for a common energy policy to be included in the"
19762,we still do not have them .
19763,"so , who has prevented it so far ?"
19764,"we do not want to replace anyone who does good in the nations , but we want to"
19765,"many of the issues raised in this report and the motion for a resolution , such as"
19766,"despite some criticism , the Commission will carefully examine the conclusions of the Parish"
19767,the Basel Committee ’ s approach to align the risk classification in future mainly with the

19769,"to avoid such distortions , it is therefore of considerable importance that institutions have a"
19770,there are some very specific issues that need to be addressed in the negotiations .
19771,I am referring to structural aid and agriculture .
19772,I would like to emphasise once again that I hope that all the negotiating partners
19773,"I believe that we should bear this in mind with full responsibility , and I believe that we"
19774,this also means that we have to ask ourselves seriously whether we want to use money
19775,I would just like to raise this question for the benefit of these countries .
19776,"as has already been said , paragraph 18 requires a legal definition of flag states of"
19777,the same applies to the Ortuondo Larrea report .
19778,"we are on the side of the Commission , which has proposed ceilings ."
19779,if we now propose minimum and maximum rates for liability for classification societies as a
19780,"Mr President , I hope that the Commission will not only keep an eye on the Council , but"
19781,I am also happy to fund further research to help us find even better measures to save this
19782,"however , ladies and gentlemen , this cannot mean that we are therefore further delaying"
19783,"our aim is to decide on this improved recovery plan in December , together with the fi"
19784,"I would warn you against underestimating this , because I believe that the participation of parliament"
19785,there are central deficits in the construction of thought .
19786,these are found both in the employment guidelines and in the broad economic policy guidelines .
19787,"in many respects , it is still based on the old-fashioned thinking that"
19788,but this is not the way of thinking that can eliminate what is still missing .
19789,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
19790,"we Greens have now heard praise , but we have also been a little bit attacked"
19791,"perhaps you are also right , Mr Pirker , in your attacks , if we think"
19792,"for example , with access to the labour market , but a colleague of yours ,"
19793,we also think about the independence of asylum seekers and also about a social reality .
19794,Mr Schulz has also made this accusation against us Greens .
19795,the consequences of a fisheries policy that is not taken into account could be devasta
19796,"unfortunately , these aspects have not been taken into account in the report so far , with"
19797,that is not enough .
19798,"we therefore ask the rapporteur , the Commission and the Council to add the fisheries"
19799,I would like to say that this progress is only possible in close cooperation with the Member States
19800,I would like to expressly thank the European Parliament for its excellent cooperation and for its un
19801,I also expressly acknowledge the positive role played by the European Parliament and its Members
19802,I have always been in favour of gaining the broadest possible support from the population and
19803,I am aware that there are still many reservations here .
19804,"we must reduce this , because only through the rule of law and uniform regulations and measures"
19805,I thank the Commission for its efforts and commitment …
19806,"the report , as it stands now , has amended the old Commission proposal to a large"
19807,we have responded more to the will of the citizens and have done more without large events .
19808,I know that this is also the attitude of the new Commissioner .
19809,I hope that the quality of the projects we will now have will compensate for the financial resources
19810,"we had requested that we vote tomorrow , so that we could have reacted to"
19811,"we would also have had more time to reach agreement on the matter , because it makes little sense"
19812,"now the argument against us is that we , as the European Parliament , still need to send a"
19813,"the Madrid meeting has ended with regard to the Middle East , and even if this resolution is approv"
19814,your justification for carrying this through today has been dropped .
19815,I would ask you to take note of that at least !
19816,"however , the citizens of our countries are right to expect solutions ."
19817,the people in our Member States share our common view that humanitarian aid should be provided to
19818,"this does not mean , however , that all the social , economic or environmental problems of this world"
19819,"on the contrary , it leads to the erosion of the high good of the right"
19820,the development of political guidelines for the tourism sector by the European Commission and the member states could
19821,"the Commission 's specific task must be to analyse the various national regulations and activities and ,"
19822,these will and can form a good basis for the development of the EU framework conditions .
19823,I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups
19824,"last Wednesday , we were actually farther away than we were together at a telephone conference ,"
19825,"nor is it a question of forcing relocation , as paragraph 10 states ."
19826,the relocation will only affect certain areas anyway .
19827,"of course , we also need truck traffic ."
19828,"but the point is that , especially in the case of excessive loads on the road and"
19829,"I have already had the opportunity to point out today that even in the Brenner area , which"
19830,I am missing a lot in this environmental programme .
19831,we would have surely still brought it in .
19832,the rapporteur 's version of the matter does not make matters any better .
19833,I am sorry for the Commission officials !
19834,we are still miles away from the ambitious conclusions of the Lisbon Council to achieve a
19835,I believe that today 's discussion was right and important in that it made it possible for Mr
19836,our group agrees with the Commissioner and also with the Lisbon – not Nice – European Council that
19837,competition will also ensure that we have a more effective and cost-effective service

19839,I am saying this also in view of the fact that my motion and my request to post

19843,I would ask the President – if he agrees – to communicate this to the Council
19844,Turkey has been served for years with arguments that I have also heard here today and that
19845,“ Not like that and not now ! ”
19846,now comes the hour of truth !
19847,this “ Not so and not now ! ” can no longer continue like this !
19848,anyone who does not recognise the moment of truth and the need for a clear
19849,we must be prepared to take this responsibility if we want to do so .
19850,"then there are reasons to introduce reporting obligations early , despite this identification ."
19851,"if I go for the other extreme , that is , to have as few obstacles as possible"
19852,"as a result , I will either have a situation where I have a directive on the service"
19853,"in the other case , I have no directive at all ."
19854,"nevertheless , I would like to make a few critical remarks ."
19855,the one critical comment concerns the structure of the present communication .
19856,"I must admit , even though I am no longer a completely inexperienced parliamentari"
19857,"I hope that the European citizen , for whom this is ultimately intended to be"
19858,hops are a special plant .
19859,allow me to give a brief overview .
19860,"it is not enough to always just make laws , directives and regulations , nor is"
19861,my group calls on the existing railway companies – and I see one of them represented in
19862,"for example , the German Federal Railways should really take advantage of the possibility of carr"
19863,I believe that this is where the traditional railways are really called upon to implement the market opening
19864,"thirdly , no unilateral change of borders ."
19865,this applies to Montenegro and also to Kosovo .
19866,we must also be clear and unambiguous on this point .
19867,I would also like to say that we must give the new Yugoslavia a chance .
19868,I hope it will be taken .
19869,"I do not rule out border changes , but I would like to clearly exclude them here"
19870,such changes may only be made on the basis of agreements .
19871,"what is certainly new is that we have included employment policy , based on the Lisbon decision"
19872,"we do not want over-regulation , Mr British Member , but the diversity"
19873,"we also attach great importance to a sensible , effective policy mix between economic and financial policy and ,"
19874,I would like to take this opportunity to appeal once again to Turkey to do so as soon as
19875,it is not just a symbol .
19876,"the death penalty is something so definitive , something so unambiguous and also something so barbar"
19877,Turkey knows very well that the abolition of the death penalty must be at the beginning of

19879,"Mr Souchet is always someone who is always on the side of agriculture , sometimes a bit"
19880,"they have done a great deal for rural agriculture in Europe , and in that sense we"
19881,we agree with your report .
19882,"we will , however , reject the legislative resolution ."
19883,"the Commission has also proposed a new definition of postal services , which surprised me a little"
19884,"since the 1997 postal services directive , we have had a definition that is"
19885,"a new definition would only create legal uncertainty , as the parties concerned would have"
19886,"however , it is the task and obligation of the respective Member State to notify regional measure"
19887,"Member States must not only notify the measures introduced at national level , but all measure"
19888,one last word : the general outcry against vaccinations in Europe and the world must end
19889,we will fight for this with all our strength and determination !
19890,"when the Commission launched its draft directive on improving tunnel safety , I was please"
19891,"after all , tunnel sections were not and are not among the most dangerous or accident-"

19896,we have a problem here which also occurs in other areas of the budget .

19900,in view of the coalition against terrorism as a whole which has been emerging worldwide since

19903,"the question remains , Mr President and Mr President-in-Office of the Council , when"

19906,if the Americans are not willing to tell us what is happening with weapons of

19908,"you should know , Mr Byrne , that we cannot all afford to show such a kind"
19909,you should take into account that we really want to decide on this proposal in the codecision procedure
19910,the interests of consumers should be the main focus .
19911,"accordingly , in my view , we should also support the timetable proposed by Mr Kinder"
19912,"with this timetable we can really send a signal to the uncertain consumer , and we"
19913,I have the impression that the Council has already moved a long way away from this .
19914,the conclusions : the negotiations are obviously difficult .
19915,"the current political situation in Angola is regrettable , all the more so because it is a country"
19916,"however , the protocol lacks precise information on the state of fish stocks in Angola ."
19917,"in order to obtain this information , the Committee on Fisheries has tabled amendments"
19918,we must help the Albanian people to build a multi-ethnic society .
19919,that is the great task that lies ahead of us .
19920,the battle for freedom in Kosovo has not yet been won .
19921,there is still a lot to do !
19922,"all our attempts and offers in the past have failed , the sending of observers"
19923,"even the Mitchell report , which we all support as a common point of reference , cannot be applied"
19924,"given this situation , I am no longer calling for greater involvement in the process ."
19925,"we want to , but we are not accepted ."
19926,what else do we have in our hands ?
19927,"we have a treaty with Israel and we should consider – Commissioner , you have already mentioned"
19928,"now to the question of the BATs , which Mr Bourlanges , Mr Wynn"
19929,the new Commission will be reviewing the award of contracts to technical assistance offices according to
19930,this issue will also be a focus in the blueprint paper for administrative and institutional reform .
19931,"against the background of this blueprint , it will then also be possible – as the European Parliament"
19932,"as far as employment policy is concerned , I still expect more from the economic growth and"
19933,"on 12 December last year , the presidents of the European Socialist Party , the European"
19934,I am convinced that hardly anyone outside this House can or will understand this .
19935,"in addition , parties tend to take themselves as particularly important ."
19936,it is no accident that citizens – and not only in my country – are very sceptical about
19937,"if you are involved , then above all in citizens ’ initiatives , in non-govern"
19938,professional auditing is an indispensable part of modern management in public administration as well as
19939,but good auditing alone is not a panacea .
19940,"I do not want to name any names here , but one could list a whole list of companies"
19941,we also want to work more concentrated .
19942,"we must refrain from time-consuming routine resolutions , even though many Member"
19943,we need a simplified procedure for non-controversial reports so that we can concentra
19944,because we all know in this House that some 80 % of European legislation now require
19945,the Italian Presidency has also been contradictory so far in its statements on the important
19946,"the investment programme for infrastructure , research and development that you and Minister Tremonti have proposed"
19947,but it is not yet clear whether only budgetary discipline will be weakened or whether Italy
19948,"here , too , I would ask you to be more clear and open if we want to implement"
19949,I am thinking in particular of the proposals made by the Commission recently under the presidency of
19950,"if you succeed in doing this , Mr Prime Minister , in making a coherent , precis"
19951,the reasons are well known .
19952,"a study commissioned by the European Parliament was just completed , which concludes that the re"
19953,the final storage is also not solved .
19954,nuclear fusion is not a solution either .
19955,it is therefore more sensible to invest in safe renewable energy sources than in nuclear
19956,it is wrong to ignore the technical and environmental realities .
19957,does it really make sense to equip boats less than twelve metres in length with a

19959,these are just a few of the many questions from the Committee on Fisheries .
19960,"we are seriously and very intensively dealing with these tasks , and we are en"
19961,why the seven core labour standards ?
19962,"these seven core labour standards are based on the four fundamental human rights at work , the right"
19963,"Five-year-olds still stand or sit at the loom , and their parents have"
19964,this is nothing new !
19965,"or the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of sex , religion , political opinion"
19966,we want these rights to be extended to workers in poorer countries .
19967,this is particularly important now that we have new partners such as China in the WTO .
19968,I would like to conclude by raising one last important point .
19969,we are now in a crucial phase of the work in the Convention on the protection of EU finance
19970,it is a crucial moment .
19971,significant progress can be made towards the creation of a European Public Prosecutor
19972,I would like to urge the Convention to give active support to this important concept .
19973,we are now in the decisive phase .
19974,"if we rightly include domestic primary energy sources , and therefore hard coal , in the European"
19975,"that is why the sections proposed by the Commission - operating aid , closure"
19976,the aim must be to abolish the funding of live animal transport .
19977,it is not acceptable in the long run that these should be supported by EU funds .
19978,I see such contradictions in other areas as well .
19979,Macedonia has been mentioned .
19980,we have witnessed for many months a courting and a non-disarmament of the
19981,KFOR has thus become complicit in the developments in Macedonia and in new conflict
19982,"we had a policy in Kosovo which was supposed to prevent ethnic cleansing , and we"
19983,I believe that a preventive and permanent security policy is not compatible with this .
19984,I also believe that the overall result of this statute is a very balanced one .
19985,"in the Committee on Legal Affairs , we have basically guided ourselves by the guide"
19986,the 50 % of a judge 's salary that is at issue here is rough
19987,"it is less than what Italian Members are receiving today , and I would therefore like"
19988,these three reports are a balancing act .
19989,"as regards feed ingredients , food safety is a highly sensitive issue ."
19990,"when scientific studies clearly speak against the use of certain substances , the precautionary principle"
19991,"I doubt , however , that we will succeed in introducing a zero tolerance thre"
19992,"this would be dubious consumer protection and , above all , certainly not practicable ."
19993,"in my view , this would undermine the legislation itself ."
19994,the lengthy programme negotiations between the Commission and the Member States
19995,"nor can anyone explain to me why the Commission , with its 18 000"
19996,nor can anyone explain to me why this is now to be an essential part of this Commission reform

19999,… of the Belliard building goes .
20000,it is also in the interest of the European Parliament that this building in Brussels be put to
20001,I would like to highlight as a particularly positive fact that both committees are making the necess

20003,I can therefore recommend that you approve Sections VI and VII of the Supplementary and
20004,the analysis of traffic accidents is crucial .
20005,"the content of the activity in relation to accident statistics is thus a collection , evaluation"
20006,a systematic study of traffic events can provide important data to ensure greater safety and prevent accident
20007,both the construction of the means of transport and the design of the roads and the people themselves
20008,we must recognize them and try to eliminate them as much as possible .
20009,"for me , this is a very important point ."
20010,I consider traffic education to be essential .
20011,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
20012,"if Basel II , as drafted by the Basel Committee , is implemented , it will make"
20013,"Conversely , however , for those businesses that need credits , i.e. money"
20014,"in Austria , for example , about 65 % of businesses finance themselves through bank loans"

20016,we in the European Parliament finalised our opinion before the end of the year in the hope that
20017,what happened ?
20018,nothing happened !
20019,the Council has not adopted a common position .
20020,"indeed , it is even apparent that the Council does not want to adopt a common position"
20021,"in Germany , it is even decided to extend the postal monopoly because there is a European stand"

20029,"Mr. Deprez , I would like to say that I am not sure of the question ."
20030,"if you want me to be even more specific , we are not putting this on hold ,"
20031,"we have only waited for this contact with the parties concerned , the representatives of the"
20032,this is of course something that should be changed within the next few weeks .
20033,"Mr President-in-Office , I should like to return to a point of recognition ."
20034,"you have made a great effort to ensure transparency , which is also a hallmark of Sweden"
20035,"that is also your merit , but not your sole merit ."
20036,"for example , your compatriot , our colleague Charlotte Cederschiöld , has"
20037,let us continue along this path .
20038,we also want to strengthen further cooperation with the Council of Ministers and to have a

20045,I am dismayed by the ECB 's severe rebuke of the employment
20046,I call on the ECB to make a constructive contribution to the success of the growth
20047,"today , monetary policy can no longer be solely responsible for price stability ."
20048,it can no longer be budgetary policy that is solely responsible for public finances and
20049,coordination is really needed here in order to further develop European economic and monetary union and
20050,it is a peculiar way of dealing with the role and responsibility of states if
20051,it is equally strange that the EU does not distance itself more decisively from

20053,"in this context , the statement of the Czech Parliament of 24 April this year is help"
20054,we are nevertheless interested in the question of whether there are discriminatory elements in the current

20061,"our discussions have become really difficult on the subject of ' transposition of European law ' ,"

20064,"Mrs Schreyer , I also expect you to answer my questions in the same way as ,"
20065,with this new programme we have consolidated and improved existing youth activities .
20066,"thanks to our amendments , we have also improved the social protection of participants ."
20067,"the amount now allocated for this is obviously not sufficient , although we have been"
20068,but the sum actually punishes the minister-Sunday speaker lies !
20069,"I am sure , however , that we will make the most of it and that many young people"
20070,"Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to congratulate"
20071,the Commission has responded to the Court of Auditors ' criticism of the use of export

20073,our final positions will have to be judged in the light of the overall negotiations
20074,the honourable Members know that the Commission is also committed to the long-term
20075,"between 1991 and 2000 , the Commission provided a total"
20076,a significant part of this was earmarked for mine clearance and related awareness-raising
20077,I will try to do my best in this regard and can point out a few points .
20078,"firstly , we are , after all , on the verge of introducing the euro in cash"
20079,"the European Union ’ s internal market will thus become a real EU home market , at least"
20080,this EU home market will include twelve member states with a single currency for all citizens and
20081,it is therefore right and important that a careful analysis of the economy in Europe is ca
20082,it has already been touched on today :
20083,"the forecasts for the current year and the analysis of the status quo are generally positive ,"
20084,"all in all , as a new Member , I would like to state once again that I believe"
20085,"I believe , however , that we must separate the issue of abortion very clearly from the"
20086,abortion is rightly a sensitive issue .
20087,I do not think it is good for the European Union to allocate the scarce resources that
20088,we are politicians and we are right to ask about politicians .
20089,"I have a quote from a Turkish newspaper , not from a newspaper of a Kurdish organisation , and"
20090,"“ Serdar Tanis , HADEP chairman in Silopi , and Ebubekir Den"
20091,"on January 25 , they went to the Gendarmerie station in Silopi following"
20092,I think that is our problem .
20093,"if such events are taking place in Turkey again and again and if nothing is done about them ,"
20094,then we must be given the right to be very critical of the Turkish question .
20095,the Commission 's preliminary draft budget was based on the framework redefined for the
20096,I very much welcome this Commission proposal for a regulation which aims to establish the legal basis for

20098,"Mr President , the protection of financial interests concerns everyone , the institutions and their members at"
20099,"however , the fact that this protection is guaranteed to be equivalent , effective and dissuasive"
20100,we represent him here and are responsible to him .
20101,I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission is presenting us with a comprehensive strategy
20102,"in practice , we can also imagine what it looks like when a facilitated rail travel document"
20103,"in the extreme case , you have to enter your address in Khabarovsk , in the east"
20104,"I can vividly imagine how well this will work in practice , given the administrative capacity of"
20105,I therefore ask you to keep an eye on this issue and not to think that we can
20106,this is particularly true of a more vigorous implementation of Community law in the Member States
20107,the Commission awaits the European Parliament 's opinion on its overall assessment and will present its
20108,a final word on the hearings .
20109,the hearings were positive .
20110,"not everyone has always been brilliant , but it is also easier when you are an"
20111,"but overall , we believe that this Commission can be a strong Commission , but , Mr Prodi"
20112,what are the objectives of this programme ?
20113,"firstly , the efficient functioning of the internal market , which is seriously affect"
20114,we need effective control and anti-fraud measures to do this .
20115,we need a network of tax administrations working together as if they were a single European tax administration
20116,"we also welcome the innovations in the Commission 's new proposals compared to the old ,"
20117,"( de ) Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report ."
20118,perhaps Mr Maat would like to say the same as I have .
20119,we talked to each other this morning .
20120,amendment 929 by the Committee on Budgets concerns two lines in head
20121,it is about young farmers and environmental measures .
20122,I would now like to table an oral amendment to change this line .
20123,we are giving young farmers EUR 10 million more and cutting the EUR 1
20124,"this is budget-neutral , but we have accommodated the Committee on Agriculture and"
20125,I am realistic enough to know that it is a gradual process .
20126,I therefore voted in favour of the report and hope that there will be many more

20128,"the programme for the Picardie region , which has a Community contribution of 1 ."
20129,the Commission is waiting for proposals from the French authorities and asks them to submit them
20130,"as regards agricultural policy , the Commission has already taken the initiative to allow producer"
20131,"Furthermore , the Commission has agreed with certain interpretations of the current legislation made"
20132,the Commission has also taken steps to extend the sowing period beyond 15 June .
20133,I am very grateful that the European Parliament has included in its resolution on sustainable pension
20134,"if we have a duty to show this solidarity and if this is our common European concern ,"
20135,we are glad that it is not in the hands of members of your country ’ s government who
20136,we prefer the President-in-Office of the Council of Home Affairs Ministers .
20137,"secondly , a good knowledge base , which conveys the important and omits the uni"
20138,it is therefore too little to say that knowledge and information should only be obtained from the
20139,those who do not have basic knowledge do not know where to get knowledge .
20140,"this knowledge base includes cultural techniques , reading , arithmetic and writing ."
20141,new technologies offer new opportunities for acquiring knowledge and applying cultural techniques .
20142,"only those who possess basic knowledge can deal with knowledge correctly , distinguish and differentiate"
20143,this report is therefore a major contribution to putting knowledge at the centre of our policie
20144,"the Commission has also already explained that the countries of the Western Balkans , but also Romania"
20145,"these countries already have a future accession prospect , and in the case of Romania and Bulgaria ,"
20146,the common position was largely satisfactory for us in Parliament as well .
20147,"after all , two thirds of the proposed amendments have been adopted and have"
20148,"the overlap with the driving licence is no longer in the text , i.e."
20149,what was very important to us was that it was not the country of origin of the drivers
20150,people from third countries should also acquire these basic qualifications .
20151,"in my opinion , which was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Women 's Rights"
20152,the NAPs lack significant proposals for improvements in the implementation of the gender
20153,women earn on average 76 % of men ’ s hourly wage .
20154,the social partners are called upon to enforce the principle of equal pay for equal work
20155,the threat of withholding structural aid funds in the event of non-implement
20156,this can certainly not be in the interests of the Commission either .
20157,"secondly , my group continues to find it unsatisfactory that , unlike in"
20158,"you , Commissioner , have done a great deal for the public , I know , but the"
20159,"I am aware of the problems , but I find it problematic that , in a process of"
20160,"as I have explicitly discussed with Mr Lechner today , it is necessary that"
20161,"for this reason , Commissioner , I would like to reiterate that we do not want to"
20162,"we have a great task ahead of us , and the exemplary assistance we can now provide"
20163,"the Council has insisted on committing a clear breach of law , despite the warning"
20164,"I would , of course , like to thank in particular all the rapporteurs and shadow rapport"
20165,the European Union has achieved a great deal in the telecommunications market over
20166,"the monopolies of the established operators have been broken , the market has been completely liberal"
20167,"falling prices , a variety of new offers and services from different operators are a result that"
20168,but of course there is nothing that does not need to be improved .
20169,this was shown by the results of the Telecoms Report in 1999 and
20170,I will mention just a few key words : unbundling of the last mile in favour
20171,there are still dumping prices offered by established operators and there are still bottlenecks in
20172,the new legal framework for telecoms regulation is intended to remedy this situation .
20173,I would like to start by briefly introducing my two reports on the telecoms

20180,"Madam President , I know that you are certainly trying to address all the problems that exist here"
20181,I think we must also be careful not to blame all the mistakes on the

20183,"we have very good arguments , we have very good policy areas and policies , and we"
20184,"we should not be afraid of the citizen , but rather approach him in a very"
20185,"Mr Varela , you are making it very clear in this report that we cannot talk about the"
20186,"like any other economic activity , fisheries are affected by globalisation ."
20187,I fully endorse much of your report and the accompanying resolution .
20188,they stress that the European fisheries policy is committed to the principle of multifunctionality
20189,"this report , for example , not only says praiseworthy things about combating racism ,"
20190,and it is precisely in these areas that this report becomes a dishonest piece of
20191,"the fight against racism , to which we are all committed , is being sold and abu"
20192,that is why we cannot support the report in its present form .
20193,one can of course conclude that we are still setting a date .
20194,"the problem is that if you set such a date , there is a risk that the will to"
20195,what do you think is the reason why certain politicians in these countries are pressing so hard
20196,"they are pushing for it so hard because they want to avoid , if possible , touching"
20197,we always have to find the right balance .
20198,"if we do not set a date , disappointment may arise , if we set a"
20199,"unfortunately , this is not the case at the moment ."
20200,but I have already pointed out that all countries are approaching the stage of accession relative
20201,I would also like to take up what Mr Perry said : multiannual programmes such as

20204,now on the question of how it was dealt with in the Conference of Presidents :
20205,"I am one of those who always like not only to lead the debates here , but also"
20206,"however , if the Conference of Presidents has finally reached a unanimous decision , then that"
20207,"it was unanimously decided that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , chaired by the este"
20208,that was a unanimous decision .
20209,"that is why I was very surprised to learn , after the Conference of Presidents , of"
20210,all of our interlocutors in Cambodia have expressed support for EU involvement in the

20212,the Commission is pleased to note that this decision is supported by the European Parliament .
20213,by maintaining the controversial Annex XV in the Accession Treaty and thereby
20214,"secondly , this summit was important because it sent a signal to the citizens of Europe ."
20215,this summit has said in its spirit : we are there for your safety .
20216,"where the Member States have run out of resources , the Union comes in – in asylum policy"
20217,"thirdly , this summit was important because , although we have so far succeeded in"
20218,"we are not giving the old , unsafe , dangerous ships that transport oil any"
20219,"at the same time , the European Parliament and the Council are prescribing that heavy transport to and"
20220,with this combination – and these are the most important elements for me : heavy oil to and from
20221,a second point from the White Paper that I would like to mention is the keyword ' culture of
20222,"yes , I think that is a very good proposal ."
20223,I think that both the Commission and the Council and Parliament would do well to think together about how
20224,I would have preferred the Commission not to propose a code of conduct for minimum standards of consulta
20225,"you have just spoken of such a dialogue , of the possible establishment of a working"
20226,I would like to make four brief comments on the two reports before us .
20227,first remark : the procedure proposed here is characterized by a pre-democratic understanding .
20228,"that was acceptable in 1952 , but it is of course no longer accept"
20229,that must be clear .
20230,let me say two or three things .
20231,"firstly , I believe that Community law must be seen as a whole ."
20232,Community law provides that if a Member State does not transpose or transposes incorrec
20233,you should do that !
20234,you should not try to achieve through the back door what you cannot achieve through lawsuits and
20235,that is something I do not think is quite right .
20236,"if you say that Member States are contrary to Community law , that they are violating Community"
20237,"but not to dare to do so , but to try to stop the disbursement of funds"
20238,"in recent years , sensitivity has increased considerably in the area of food , including ,"
20239,anyone who thinks of BSE or dioxin knows what I mean .
20240,the discussions in connection with the Paulsen reports have also clearly shown this .
20241,this sensitivity is also created in the case of the trade in feed - I would say

20261,"we remained firm on this point , and now it is clear that we have taken the right"
20262,the first is Palestine .
20263,there are various accusations being made here that have not so far proved to be grounded
20264,"for if you are , like me , a total supporter of aid to Palestine , it is"
20265,"the new Finance Minister and the new Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority are a good sign , but"

20277,the French stereotype of preferring no treaty to a bad one is also not conducive
20278,this is a test case for me .
20279,we should not allow blackmail to take place on this issue .
20280,"I believe that there must be a willingness to compromise , which was negotiated in"
20281,we should now be able to return to these criteria and achieve them .

20300,"as an engineer , you should know that ."
20301,"since there will be absolute protection for existing boats , which will be allowed to sail"

20315,for us Austrians it is also clear that the possibility of national regulation alone is not

20325,I would like to say on behalf of my group that the European Central Bank has done excellent
20326,"it has taken some very important decisions , for example , its decision on what price stability"
20327,this is of great importance for the long-term development of our debate on this issue .
20328,"the European Central Bank , i.e. the Governing Council of the European Central Bank ,"
20329,"in this respect , it has passed its test ."
20330,"I would point out , however , that it has passed this test in good economic weather ."
20331,"it may have been a bit dull at times , but overall we are living in a period"
20332,the possibility of regulating the implementation of the directive by means of collective agreement
20333,"it must only be done in the spirit of the directive , without any backdoors or"
20334,these are the issues that my colleague Mr Elles has mentioned .
20335,this also includes a very important area which has given rise to a great deal of critic
20336,I would be grateful if you could include this point in detail in the communication planned
20337,"that will be very , very important ."
20338,the harmonisation of document protection in the European Union is particularly aimed at promoting
20339,I fully agree with this and there should be no further demands from the parties concerned .
20340,"however , in my opinion , the extension of the centralised authorisation procedure for medicinal products ,"
20341,the current two-pillar authorisation procedure fully meets the requirements of the internal market and
20342,"in conclusion , I would like to say that these young farmers need not only reliable policies"
20343,because only from this environment do they draw strength for their so important tasks for society .

20347,everything you did and the way you did it was excellent .
20348,that cannot necessarily be said of all the others .
20349,"on the issue of journalists and freedom of the media , I can only agree with Mr Kara"
20350,"however , the opinion , also expressed in this House , that the good reputation of the"
20351,I myself come from this profession and unfortunately know only too well that there is humanity
20352,"for this reason , I believe that good reputation is not a sufficient guarantee at the moment"
20353,Arthur Andersen also had a good reputation until the disaster for this company .
20354,this initiative is intended to give new impetus to rural areas in order to develop and
20355,I am also pleased that Parliament basically supports the Commission 's view that LEA
20356,"as a Commission , Mrs Schreyer , you are ultimately cutting your own flesh ."
20357,you cannot expect Parliament to stand up to you and defend you against unjustified attacks if
20358,I influenced the Schmid report not only in the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal
20359,let me briefly outline the basic considerations behind my report .
20360,the area premium is to be set at 126 euros per tonne or 6
20361,the area premium is set in the regulation on the support scheme for crop producers and for
20362,"it goes without saying , therefore , that the regional basic area plans of this regulation must be"
20363,since flax and hemp are mainly grown for non-food purposes and no
20364,"if we do not start to change the system , we will have this discussion here at least three"
20365,"so , what are we changing about the system ?"
20366,Mr Byrne has thankfully pointed out a number of points .
20367,"yes , we need strict legislation on feed hygiene ."
20368,"yes , we need to separate the production of animal and plant feed ."
20369,"yes , we need stricter licensing for feed producers , a registration procedure for the"
20370,"yes , every feed manufacturer must have a biochemist in the operation , and constantly ,"
20371,these are all banalities that we could all take for granted .
20372,I would ask the other groups - and I will say something to the candidates in a moment
20373,"I would like to say to you , Mr President , and to all of us , that I"
20374,"I believe that in many respects , such campaigns will be more supported if we make"
20375,"in Burkina Faso , according to the figures I have , agricultural production has fallen"
20376,"instead , things were discussed that do not belong on the European agenda at the moment"
20377,how many more countries are we supposed to open negotiations with ?
20378,"we must finally develop a gradual process of cooperation between the European Union and countries in Central ,"
20379,what is the situation with regard to compliance with the convergence criteria in the

20381,this is the only way to overcome the weakness of the euro .
20382,I do not think it is possible to have very specific joint arrangements - if you asked me
20383,"I must draw your attention to the fact that , for example , the question of transitional period"
20384,"this is a German problem , and it is an Austrian problem ."
20385,"for the other thirteen it is not a problem , and therefore it is not possible to"
20386,I therefore call for the so-called technical assistance offices to be replaced at
20387,"the national bodies must be provided with adequate human , material and financial resources to enable"
20388,we need a consistent European approach at the level of criminal prosecution .
20389,the prosecution of cross-border fraud against the Community budget still too often stops at
20390,"we should be careful , however , not to use this regulation to subject official veterinarians ,"
20391,the veterinarians are assisted by official specialist assistants .
20392,the legal independence of both groups of persons is important for successful work .
20393,we know that this directive is an important part of the Financial Services Action Plan .
20394,what are the strategic objectives of this Action Plan for a Single Financial Market ?
20395,"firstly , ensuring a single corporate market for financial services ; secondly , creat"

20398,"I am very pleased that paragraph 52 of the report states that , following the agreement"
20399,the conditions must be met for this to happen .
20400,this will be reviewed at the end of 2004 .
20401,I am also in favour of this not happening now but at the end of 2
20402,"nor can this report , as an interim report , in any way mean that Parliament has decided"

20404,the European Parliament will be represented in the Convention .
20405,"they are fighting for it - and we strongly welcome this - the Commission , the national"

20414,"it is quite clear that we need to do more to tackle common challenges together , such as"

20416,"I promise my colleagues , and in particular Mr Casaca , who will be presenting"
20417,"I am pleased , Mr President , that you are chairing the sitting at the moment"
20418,so it is a pleasure to see you here today !
20419,the negotiating process as such has been significantly accelerated over the past year .
20420,I would like to point out a misunderstanding that sometimes creeps in when we talk
20421,the pace cannot be measured simply by the number of chapters negotiated .
20422,the material substance of the chapters at issue is decisive .
20423,"with the countries of the Luxembourg Group , all the remaining chapters were opened during the"
20424,"with the Helsinki Group , at least 84 chapters will be opened by the end"
20425,"I expect that next year , all the remaining chapters will also be opened for at"
20426,"Mr President , I would ask you to ensure that the German version of Amendment No"
20427,this cannot be called a “ democracy committee . ”
20428,this is a wrong translation .
20429,"it should not have a formal character , but remain an informal matter ."
20430,"therefore , please change the German text , the English is the correct text ."
20431,"that is why my group , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats"
20432,"we ask the Commission to prepare a Green Paper on the current state of affairs , which will"
20433,we also ask you to put a proposal on the table for us on what you think is the

20435,"this Parliament cannot be satisfied with a role as framework legislator , but we must"
20436,we will pay attention to that .
20437,"what we will also be looking for , Mr Prodi - and I think that is clear from"
20438,"the third thing , which is also clear , is that the Commission , with its two statements"
20439,"fortunately , this was clear today ."
20440,I therefore think that we can approach this form of parity and equivalent cooperation with great

20442,"I am sorry that the European Parliament 's amendment was not adopted , which called"
20443,"despite everything , I believe that it is a great success for Parliament and also a great success"
20444,"finally , a third question , at least touched upon ."
20445,there is no mention of the historically unprecedented inflationary effect of international specula
20446,"in my opinion , it is already leading to an inflationary trend in the medium term and is"
20447,"I hope that the necessary discussion on this development and on the instruments to change it , such"
20448,we can already see the benefits of the political changes in the economic development .
20449,the enlargement countries of Central and Eastern Europe were only weakly integrated into the world
20450,they now trade between 50 and 70 % of their foreign trade with the EU
20451,we have high surpluses on our foreign trade with all these countries .
20452,"this can be translated into higher tax revenues , higher social security contributions and , above all"
20453,"in my opinion for the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities , we"
20454,we have included in the draft directive the protection of maternity and the need for parenta

20457,free and fair world trade is the basis for the WTO negotiations - that was my
20458,"an amendment was then adopted in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research"
20459,opinions differ as to which adjectives should be added .
20460,I definitely mean ' free and fair world trade ' .
20461,there was a consensus among all .
20462,"the question of "" is socially balanced "" or "" socially acceptable "" was controvers"
20463,"we should therefore vote on the original text , in the sense that we say ' free and"
20464,then we would have the result on the third point .
20465,"my last point is foreign , security and defence policy ."
20466,we congratulate the Finnish Presidency on taking a courageous step as a traditionally

20468,it would be bad for the European Union if we talked about European defence but did not

20470,"it must be equipped with a truly democratic policy , one that is based on human"

20475,"in this context , I would also like to make it clear that it is not only a question"
20476,I believe that the Council must come to Parliament 's aid here too .
20477,"a few months earlier , the Commission had presented a comprehensive strategic report which show"
20478,"since the draft budget was drawn up in spring , important events have taken place which were"
20479,"most importantly , we have had to witness this year a war on European soil ,"
20480,few people say it – Mr Voggenhuber was very clear on this – but
20481,it must be said so clearly : changing the results of the Convention would be a sign
20482,"this would certainly have consequences for ratification , whether through parliaments or through referendums"
20483,"firstly , there is no certainty of planning for the financing of enlargement beyond"
20484,I think the method of the coercive strategy is questionable .
20485,citizens must know what is coming to them .
20486,they have a right to it .
20487,"this is not an intellectually understated argument , Commissioner ."
20488,what rules should apply to imports so that the national fixed book prices are not undermined
20489,"if we can agree on this point , then I believe we have solved the problem ."
20490,"secondly , if we want to do justice to Lisbon and Gothenburg , we must no"
20491,we must exploit the full potential of environmental policy to make it usable for qualification and
20492,"thirdly , Mr Karas rightly points out in his report that economic policy is a matter"
20493,"if we want to coordinate this , we must also have the courage to talk about investment"
20494,the European Parliament will be involved in this discussion and we must secure our legal position in this
20495,Mr Brok rightly began his speech by pointing out that we will all be the beneficiari
20496,"Commissioner Verheugen , you have rightly emphasised that the issue is no longer whether"
20497,but it is precisely in this how and when that we must all ensure that enlargement is
20498,"I believe that the more the Union is deepened in this Intergovernmental Conference , the"
20499,"at the same time , however , this also means that the more the European Union is deepened"
20500,"Mr President , we say we want to discuss on an equal footing , yet those who"
20501,transparency is not guaranteed .
20502,"we are there , the interpreters are there , but the video service cannot be there because it"
20503,I think that is an unacceptable situation !
20504,"I actually wanted to say something to the Group of the Greens , which is now shining"
20505,when we are talking about enlargement and when we will be welcoming observers from the candidate
20506,I find it regrettable that the Greens have tabled amendments to delete these passage
20507,that is exactly the opposite of what we need if we want to integrate more than
20508,several speakers have criticised the Commission for not addressing certain problems .
20509,"I can only assume that these speakers have not read the report , because all the problems that"
20510,it is also wrong that the Kurdish problem is not called by its name .
20511,"wherever Kurdish language , Kurdish culture , Kurdish settlements , Kurdish parties are concerned , it"
20512,anyone who says that the word or term ‘ Kurdish ’ does not appear has obviously
20513,I must protest against the impression that has been given here that the 2000 report
20514,that is not the case .
20515,"the European Union supports health care , it supports education ."
20516,we want to use the grants to preserve the chance for a peace process .
20517,"that is our objective , and I am very pleased that Minister Pérez stressed yesterday"
20518,"firstly , there is the EU-Turkey relationship ."
20519,the second is the development of Greek-Turkish relations and the peace process in Cyprus .
20520,"to support production processes , the regulation provides guidelines for good process practice ."
20521,"as a rule , these will be sectoral and national guidelines , developed by many stakeholder"
20522,the application is of course voluntary – and Parliament also supports this .
20523,"however , if European guidelines are drawn up for a particular sector or production , they are"
20524,"European guidelines should therefore replace sectoral , national or regional guidelines , not least because"

20528,"first and foremost , we must start training and deploying the necessary human resources ."
20529,there is no mention of this or a uniform European orientation .
20530,"this , in turn , is something that the Commission should definitely take into account and address"
20531,"we should not condemn these phenomena from the high moral horse ahead of time , as long"
20532,"we should , however , give these countries the practical assistance they need on their way to the"

20540,I am very grateful to Commissioner Schreyer for comparing the figures .
20541,what was the preliminary draft ?
20542,what proposals has the Council put on the table ?
20543,how should this be assessed in the context of the financial ceilings on expenditure that

20545,but I would also like to make it very clear that there are international commitments made to develop
20546,this is lacking in imagination and politically unresponsible .
20547,that is simply accounting !

20572,thank you for your attention !
20573,this brings me back to the current protein gap .
20574,it has been criticised that the Commission has only taken an economic approach .
20575,I must ask Parliament whether it is justifiable that we should spend six times as much in additional

20577,"the previous speaker , Mr Lehne , has already pointed out that the first milestone in"
20578,"so far , this is the only European legislation that has regulated cross-border collateral"
20579,we need uniform regulation of this matter in order to create an efficient internal market .

20582,"we need to eliminate the legal uncertainty of 15 different legal systems ,"
20583,we also need to eliminate the different insolvency laws .
20584,there is therefore a need for a uniform minimum regulation .
20585,"in addition , various damages have also occurred in the fishing sector , particularly in"
20586,"therefore , fishing had to be stopped in some areas , also because of the oil"
20587,"we are working very closely with the French authorities on this , and the Commissioner responsible"
20588,the Community must show solidarity with the people affected and we must really use every opportunity -
20589,"at the end of my speech , I would like to pay tribute to one more point ."
20590,"I think there are courageous women officials in the Commission , and I am not deliberate"
20591,"I hope that such courageous work will in future be more appreciated , praised and"
20592,influence on the administration of justice in the Member States is excluded .
20593,the Court of Justice is to be responsible for monitoring the legality of the acts .
20594,we also call on the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to launch the debate on the
20595,I also think that the Commission is in part too polite when it comes to pointing out
20596,I think that the responsibility of the Member States should be addressed more clearly .
20597,"this terror , which is threatening to germinate again here , shows , however , that"
20598,I therefore expect us to take the most decisive action against the terrorism we have known so
20599,"I would ask all of you to give your massive support to this package of measures ,"
20600,there is also a lot to fight against in the organization .
20601,we need framework regulations without unilateral preferences .
20602,we need a change in the reorganisation at the ministerial level .
20603,"given the unanimity principle , we might need a round of the M7 , the"
20604,"we need a round of parliamentarians , perhaps with a majority right , and thirdly"
20605,I am currently in close contact with the Bulgarian Government on this matter .

20607,"however , no breakthrough has been achieved in the negotiations ."
20608,Mrs Peijs 's good report addresses the current obstacles and strategies for achi
20609,there was a great deal of consensus in committee .
20610,what can we do internally for short sea shipping ?
20611,I just want to say a few things :
20612,"in the technical area , introduce more environmentally friendly engine technology and specific terminals for express handling"
20613,"in the organisational area , especially in cross-border transport , uniform transport documents , simplified"
20614,the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs introduces two important changes to the
20615,"firstly , we want a different definition of the term co-determination than the Council ."
20616,the employee representative body referred to is nothing more than a special European Works Council for the
20617,but they are and remain rights of information and consultation .
20618,"the label "" co-determination "" would be wrong here ."
20619,"in the Yukos case , the freezing of a large proportion of Yukos shares has"

20621,we are against it .

20627,"with the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993,"

20635,why do we need the regulation ?
20636,despite the complete liberalisation of the telecommunications market in Europe since 1

20642,"it was therefore right that this European Parliament always focused on an information campaign , that it"
20643,"in this respect , it is also important that we send positive signals ."
20644,"the fact that , at least since yesterday , consumers have been feeling the benefits of monetar"
20645,"further benefits will be visible , for example , now in the holiday season ."
20646,this is certainly also due to the efforts of this European Parliament .
20647,"on 6 June , as rapporteur , I recommended to the Committee on Budgetary Control"
20648,today I voted against this discharge .
20649,the acute problems are part of what the Socialists and Democrats will pay attention to in
20650,"of course , consumer confidence and food quality are also acute problems ."
20651,these are two of the major priorities that have been seriously affected in recent weeks and
20652,"but we cannot stand there now and pretend that they do not exist , simply stick our heads"
20653,we must indeed make the issue of consumer protection and food quality one of the top priorities
20654,this paper in this shortness is a farce !
20655,it is a farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what is
20656,such a paper is not at all a basis for a scoreboard .

20671,"almost exactly five years ago , on 2 December 1998 , this"
20672,"in retrospect , this debate was the beginning of the end of the Commission at the time ."
20673,"then , as now , it was about the fight against fraud , about the consequences that the"

20676,"we , for our part , rejected this very strongly because no one could answer the question"
20677,one question that remains open for us concerns the courier services .
20678,"some people think they should be included , others think that the many accidents are not a question"
20679,we have also introduced flexibility in the breaks .
20680,"we did not only want weekends between 24 and 45 hours , but also"
20681,"we also want to take account of the countries that are not located in Central Europe , because tomo"

20695,you are a man of your personality enough to play a pioneering role in the whole world

20697,"a second aspect was also raised by the rapporteur , which was also important to us in"

20721,"the European Social Fund is certainly an effective instrument , but we Europeans should also link it"
20722,"without European sanctions , we will probably not be able to survive in the long term"
20723,"Commissioner , my group is on your side in this ."
20724,national employment plans are often still considered a secret government document – unknown to national MPs and

20738,I would be very pleased if we in the European Parliament could agree on a uniform language in

20742,"therefore , two more comments :"
20743,I just mentioned it .
20744,Erika II - it must not take as long as Erika I did .
20745,"oil spills are one thing , but damage to people , nature , fisheries and tourism"
20746,that is why we should implement the proposals that Parliament has made more quickly .

20748,"the Commission is counting on the European Parliament , it is confident that the European Parliament will"

20917,"this , too , is part of such a debate ."
20918,I would now like to comment on two main demands in the report : the survey of vessel
20919,the following points were important to the Committee on Budgets :
20920,"firstly , there was a point which at first glance seemed to be budgetary ,"
20921,the Committee on Budgets called for Community aid to Turkey to be financed no longer from
20922,"it is not just about the economy , it is about the environment , it is about cooperation"
20923,we also expect something from these countries .
20924,"we are not always able to just give , but we want political and economic reforms , democracy"
20925,"it is also a matter of our wishing to know , by means of a check , to"
20926,we must improve the European Union 's information and analysis capacity .
20927,"I believe that we should not create duplicate structures , but rather pool the resources of the"
20928,"when drawing up and adopting technical specifications , economic costs must be taken into account ,"
20929,the effectiveness and safety of the whole trans-European high-speed rail system depends
20930,we therefore need a corresponding code or a list of words for company communication .
20931,"we must not organise all this at minimum levels and minimum safety levels , but we must ensure"
20932,a solution to the Cyprus issue will be a major contribution to the development of relations between the
20933,relations between Greece and Turkey have improved considerably .
20934,the Commission very much welcomes the confidence-building measures agreed .
20935,"I would like to congratulate the two Foreign Ministers , Ismail Cem and Georgios"
20936,both Foreign Ministers have done a great deal to create a favourable climate for further

20938,the Greek-Turkish relations have improved significantly .
20939,"just a few days ago , the Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers confirmed that both countries want"
20940,"finally , I must say that the Cyprus talks have also been resumed within the frame"
20941,"to date , five rounds of talks have already taken place ."
20942,this is already an important success in itself .
20943,I would like to appeal to them once again .
20944,I know how difficult the subject is .
20945,I also know how sensitive this subject is .
20946,"but let us try to maintain these common pillars , which we discussed together a year ago"
20947,"I hope that the German Social Democrats , who speak quite differently to their Minister of the"
20948,I also hope that we will once again find a way of achieving consensus that will give
20949,I do not want to go so far as to say that renationalisation has taken place in
20950,I am very sorry for this and I fear that the only thing that will really get the Council
20951,only then will the Council move .
20952,the Member States must stop playing their own game and instead play a European game with European targets
20953,"Europe is not only unified , but also characterised by its cultural diversity ."
20954,this is an invaluable asset and it promotes peaceful coexistence in Europe .
20955,"I am committed to ensuring that people in Europe not only live side by side ,"
20956,the euro is indeed a historic milestone in integration and offers great potential for further economic
20957,"in this respect , we always emphasise the opportunities , of course , but we do not"
20958,"we do not underestimate the problems , but tackle them ."
20959,"I would like to thank the European Parliament for its support on this point , which shows that we"
20960,"at some point , it makes no sense to ask about guilty or innocent , because"
20961,"as Europeans , we not only have a great interest in seeing real peace in this region"

20982,the only thing that is now at stake is negotiating what the next step in this liberal
20983,it must be clear that liberalisation must go in both directions .
20984,it is therefore not only a question of what concessions we make to the Kingdom of
20985,it was important for us that temporary workers are not used to break strikes or contribute to
20986,more than three quarters of temporary workers are still men .
20987,the reason for women 's absence is the difficulty of reconciling work and family
20988,temporary work in particular allows the desired individual adaptation and gives women good opportunities
20989,a final comment across categories 3 and 4 : what about the timetable promised
20990,you wrote to us last December that a proposal would be available in mid-April .
20991,we are all very excited about it .
20992,"we are in mid-May and we hope that this will be done quickly , because it is"
20993,"it is also the Commission 's task to consider how this can be countered , how the"
20994,if we compare what remains to be done in the remaining 12 to 1
20995,"what we cannot accept , however , is that there is an attempt to ‘ simply pocket"
20996,"that would be unfair to us , and we must make that clear ."
20997,"we are convinced that safe jobs , a positive working environment and adequate workers ' rights do"
20998,work for all is the goal .
20999,we want a strategy for more and better jobs .
21000,"quality of work includes job satisfaction , the motivation of employees is increased , and health and"
21001,we are waiting for a proposal from the Commission on the statute of temporary workers .
21002,"the quality of work also includes gender equality , the reconciliation of family and work ,"
21003,"Madam Vice-President , in this context , I have a question for you :"
21004,can you briefly describe where the Commission 's proposals go beyond the existing negoti
21005,I believe it is very important that we do not spend the next few years philosophising about who
21006,it is about you finally realising that you owe the European public a full account of what you
21007,then we will hopefully enter into that new culture of political administration in Brussels which Mr Pro
21008,"Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the two general rapporteurs in particular on"
21009,let me make two basic comments on this :
21010,"the Commission , as the competent authority , has repeatedly earned itself the respect of"
21011,it should continue along this path .
21012,"however , Commissioner , all this will not be any less complicated in the future – I just"
21013,"it is not only about modernising Community law , it is more important than ever to ensure transparenc"
21014,the example of Austria is bad because you are painting a picture of the European Union interfering in
21015,"this is not the European Union that the European citizens want , nor do the candidate countries want it"
21016,"unfortunately , this has happened under your presidency ."
21017,"we still have a difficult road ahead of us , that is quite clear ."
21018,"however , as was again made clear yesterday , the political momentum is so strong that it"
21019,"there is not a single member state that combines its demands and wishes , which"
21020,it is important to note that all 15 Member States reiterated their commitment to
21021,I would therefore like to formulate two brief expectations for the Council in Brussels .
21022,the least we need from the Heads of State or Government is an agreement that allows us
21023,"the Commission does not believe it is possible to make compromises until Copenhagen , because that would put"
21024,"the enlargement process cannot be dictated , but must be the result of a mutual agreement"
21025,"Furthermore , and this is the second point I would like to emphasise here ,"
21026,the recent crisis in the Commission has shown more than clearly how much there is a la
21027,this is also and above all because disciplinary proceedings are an internal matter of the Commission
21028,"so , in fact , one cannot even blame the parties involved if , from the outset"
21029,here only outsourcing such processes and transferring them to an external stand can help .
21030,"what we need is a chamber for budgetary discipline , and I believe that such a chamber would"
21031,he has the necessary expertise in financial matters and he has the necessary independence .
21032,"however , this reform would also require a change in the Treaties ."
21033,"if we do not carry out such a reform , all the fine announcements that we are"
21034,"thirdly , the convergence of the media must be taken into account in the new legal"
21035,"however , this must not lead to the freely expanding mobile market , which is characterised"
21036,mobile operators are already being severely affected by the auctioning of UMTS frequ
21037,experts estimate that it will take several years to generate the auction amounts alone .
21038,"this alone is very detrimental to Europe 's future industry , the mobile telecom"
21039,this adverse effect must not be exacerbated by the imposition of ex ante
21040,"like the previous speaker , I am also against the very vague wording of the only a"
21041,I therefore fully support this resolution and am against the amendment .
21042,I have a different view of Mr Heaton-Harris 's contribution to the debate
21043,if the Court of Auditors does not officially announce an error rate - as it has done
21044,but what is relevant for Parliament as an institution is that it has not done so .
21045,we as Parliament are not the arbiters of internal quarrels in the Court of Audi
21046,"if there are , we expect a clear statement from the Court of Auditors in this regard ."
21047,the search functions could also work .
21048,"once these most banal things are done , then you can – I think – think about what"
21049,"one can now imagine holding referendums across Europe with very , very little access and low financial"
21050,"finally , I would like to ask the Commission what it is actually going to do to ensure"
21051,"the Commission has received warnings in this regard for a long time , most recently from its own"
21052,the Commission will have to pay a high price for not taking such warnings seriously .
21053,so Parliament is also involved here .
21054,"I very much hope that we will now succeed in reaching a result in Brussels ,"
21055,"if there is no result in Brussels , then there will be a delay in the nego"
21056,"I must say , on behalf of our group , that we consider it irresponsible if"
21057,that is why it is a major political mistake that these new conditions are now emerging .
21058,we could have talked about this much earlier .
21059,it would be tragic if the candidate countries were to end up being the victims of the
21060,I will now confine myself to this point .
21061,"in many Member States , pensions are understood to be the guarantee of basic living conditions"
21062,"this includes covering so-called biometric risks , financial protection in old age ,"
21063,"in concrete terms , this means , for example , that a worker who has a car accident"
21064,the health of citizens is a major concern for us all .
21065,we therefore need clear and reasonable requirements and laws that meet the objectives of
21066,when I think of the science fiction film “ The Year 2036 ” from
21067,"it will be very important to continue to achieve a common position among the Member States , and your"
21068,it will also help us if the good cooperation we have had with the Council and also within
21069,"we should not throw out the child with the bathwater , however , and I am address"
21070,we have just seen this with the leftovers .
21071,we must also achieve reasonable recycling wherever it is reasonable .
21072,I was yesterday in a factory for dog and cat food .
21073,"if we look at the meticulousness with which controls are carried out , we"
21074,"if the word Beneš decrees has already been mentioned , I am very pleased"
21075,"at the same time , I would say that it would be beneficial for the climate of nego"
21076,let ’ s look to the future .
21077,I urge our Bureau to invite both President Karzai and the chairperson of the independent human

21080,the Commission was somewhat weak on the issue of targeting :
21081,how many kilograms do we want to collect per year ?
21082,we call for a ban on disposable products .
21083,"some participants in this discussion , especially industry , claim that this is a crazy proposal ."
21084,I say the exact opposite .
21085,we must come to the point where it is forbidden to throw a razor in the
21086,"although this is very banal , many have not understood it yet ."
21087,the law of falling unit costs also prohibits that we have wandering quantities in the
21088,we need to concentrate them to reduce the recycling costs .
21089,that is why we have proposed a ban on discarding and a binding quota of
21090,it is not right that we should postpone it because colleagues cannot be here in the
21091,"so , long talk , short sense : I would agree on behalf of my group to post"

21100,the issue of initiating a comprehensive reform of the Structural Funds mechanism
21101,the President 's right to have the last word on certain matters is based on the fact that

21104,the Socialist Group will also vote in favour of this report .
21105,"we believe that international cooperation can only gain from research , without denying that there are also"
21106,but even more investment is needed in education and training if the knowledge-based society is to become
21107,investments would have to increase from 21 % to 25 % .
21108,"this applies first and foremost to private investment , which would create the productive capacities"
21109,but public investment must also increase .
21110,"we need investments here , especially in the area of infrastructure measures , which have suffered"
21111,a 3 % target should be introduced for the stability programmes .
21112,I think that would be worth considering .
21113,I welcome the agreements before us .
21114,"we must not be blind and , above all , we must not give them a blank cheque !"
21115,"since the Commission proposal only marginally addresses these ethical issues , the Committee on Legal Affairs"
21116,"we therefore believe that it is absolutely necessary to clarify that , in line with"
21117,to put it plainly : donations of human tissues or cells must be voluntary and
21118,"they must also be anonymous , and persons who are incapable of giving consent"
21119,I am thinking in particular of disabled people .
21120,"secondly , the development of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime , including through Europ"
21121,"the proposed establishment of Eurojust is , in our view , a major success of"
21122,we welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start working .
21123,"the Council must also bear in mind that , in order to increase the effectiveness of the fight"
21124,I know that the right of asylum is a very difficult and politically sensitive issue .
21125,"I believe , however , that we have made a start in the discussions in committee over the"
21126,we discussed with each other in a very constructive and fair manner .
21127,"this discussion has given me courage and I am now convinced that we are able , as"

21134,I would like to begin by thanking the Commission for its commitment to closing the gap
21135,this is very important .
21136,it has presented appropriate proposals for supplementing the trans-European networks and
21137,I think that is very positive .
21138,"there is , of course , a great deal of discussion in our region about some of these"
21139,what we still lack – and here I would like to ask again – is a fairly
21140,"it would be very important for us to know this , also in relation to the population , which"
21141,"that is why we call on the Commission and the Council to act now , before it is too"
21142,I would like to take this opportunity to add two brief remarks :
21143,there are two arguments in the current debate that the Commission cannot accept .
21144,the first argument is that we cannot conclude the enlargement negotiations in this way because
21145,"this is an argument that reveals only a modest intellectual ambition , because this applies"
21146,"Furthermore , it is essential that the Member States have the possibility , in accordance"
21147,an analysis of the infringement proceedings from 1996 to
21148,"unfortunately , the Council of Ministers often ignores the communications from the Committee on"
21149,this shows a negative attitude towards the right of European citizens to petition .
21150,the Council should pay the necessary attention to the rights of European citizens in future .
21151,"the rapporteur and the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism as a whole have tried with"
21152,"I emphasise this very strongly , because there was a political struggle by many Member"
21153,"today , I can say that , despite all the political differences in the committee , there"
21154,"it was remarkable how the official Spanish authorities , during the hearing in committee , appare"
21155,"during the subsequent on-site visit to Galicia , this attitude had changed ."
21156,the guiding principle has always been free and fair world trade in the interest of the European economy
21157,we are therefore in the tradition of our earlier work .
21158,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner responsible now , Mr Lamy ,"
21159,"since the new Commission has taken up its work , we have been engaged in an intensive"
21160,"Mr President , I was pleased to vote in favour of this Pirker report , since"
21161,"since then , considerable progress has been made by the Member States through the Italian feasibility"
21162,"however , this is only a first step in the right direction , and I would like to make"
21163,"as regards the proposed training institution , I suggest that the Police Academy , which was also"
21164,I believe that we are then on the right path .
21165,crime is internationally organised and we must finally organise the fight against crime in a cross
21166,the task of tackling climate change is so enormous that it will be extremely difficult
21167,that is exactly the question that we are facing .
21168,"are we prepared to follow the path decided in Gothenburg , which I support , even"
21169,with words it is simply said .
21170,Proclaiming to take these burdens on is simple and free .
21171,"but afterwards , the implementation will be incredibly difficult ."
21172,"my fear is – and I say this quite openly – that the Europeans , or many"
21173,"in reality , we are far from meeting the Kyoto Protocol ."
21174,we all know that .
21175,the Commission is feeding us with new and new figures .
21176,that means that we are really facing a Herculean task - I just want to say
21177,our first demand therefore : Uncover mistakes and learn from them !
21178,but many of my colleagues do not want an evaluation of the WTO 's
21179,why in the world is an evaluation being so vehemently rejected ?

21182,"I would therefore very much welcome , for example , if the newly elected Mexican President"
21183,I would like to thank you again very much !
21184,this concept lacks everything that is really needed in this region .
21185,"I welcome the fact , Commissioner , that you have recognised this error , and the approach"

21191,my third remark : I made a mistake yesterday !
21192,I would like to say that in conclusion .
21193,I criticised my Socialist colleagues from Austria for their contradictory voting behavi
21194,"that is not true , they agreed ."
21195,"that does not change my criticism of the double standards of Austrian Social Democracy , which"
21196,but I have to admit this mistake .
21197,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by saying that the European"
21198,"first of all , I would like to thank you , Mr Busk , for your excellent report"
21199,"as we all know , the multiannual guidance programmes are important instruments of fleet"
21200,I agree with you on that .
21201,the annual report reveals that the objectives of MAP4 were far too low-level

21208,"in this sense , we voted in favour of the report with our additional amendments"
21209,"Mr President , yesterday we received a yellow letter from the Green Vice-President , with nuts"
21210,"the letter was about supporting the export of products from Vanuatu , one of the developing countries"
21211,I think this is a very good and very good idea .
21212,I will gladly support that .
21213,what only surprised me was that in that letter the Vice-President expressly stated that
21214,"I would now ask the Vice-President to explain how these nuts were illegally imported , because"
21215,"this is a contradiction in itself , and I would ask him to clarify this ."
21216,it is precisely because the public is so interested in this issue and because the recent events in
21217,the Commission therefore considers that Lithuania and Slovakia have made the necessary commitments in the
21218,this does not preclude the possibility of further flexibility .
21219,the Commission considers the commitments made by Lithuania and Slovakia as necessary steps towards effective de
21220,but the goal itself has not yet been achieved .
21221,"as regards Community competences , I would like to refer to the Convention : the Convention works"

21228,"as far as Peru is concerned , several speakers have already pointed out , and our"
21229,"I am not sure , however , whether this will be the case , because we have already seen"
21230,I therefore think it is extremely important for the European Union to engage in a very detail

21233,it is not true that a single product that is safe today will disappear from the market
21234,everyone must be able to afford to carry a security record .
21235,everyone must be able to afford it !
21236,"we demand this for every single product we buy , for cosmetics , for pharmaceuticals"

21304,where is the evidence that you are serious about the joint approach between the European Parliament and the Commission
21305,there is no clear concept .

21312,let me say something about these three points .
21313,"firstly , we are planning financial increases for political priorities for the cross-border programme"
21314,the new external borders of the European Union need greater support for cooperation across these border
21315,the second chapter is nuclear safety .
21316,"this is also a priority for this Parliament , and we want to see this reflected in"
21317,"Madam President , I made this statement on behalf of Mr von Boetticher , who had"
21318,once again to the point itself :
21319,I understand your concern about small-scale fisheries and it is true that these smaller
21320,"when we in the Commission took the decisions on the fisheries reform proposals , we"
21321,we have absolutely the same view here .
21322,I agree that we must do everything possible to ensure that this small-scale coastal fishing
21323,this is the only way to ensure that all aid not covered by the Code is strict
21324,a Council regulation which is directly applicable law must also be respected by the regional governments
21325,distortions of competitive conditions and market imbalance must also be avoided in the future .
21326,"I know that this is a difficult debate , because it is about the acquis ."
21327,"however , this also involves a fundamental question , namely the question of what solidarity means"
21328,I now come to the point .
21329,"for us , it is completely unacceptable to lift the de facto moratorium , because very"
21330,I also find it unacceptable what is happening here .
21331,"we have the Scheele report , we have had a debate on the de facto moratorium ."
21332,"we have also discussed the Fiori report very broadly and in detail , in which it"
21333,the report before us calls for the exact opposite .
21334,it is clear that they do not want to accept that what has long been demanded in other

21336,"if we really want to help them , we must work to change the economic framework ."
21337,this means that our administrative systems and laws need to be modernised and simplified .
21338,the far too high tax rate must be reduced considerably .
21339,these measures must be safeguarded by adding limits on administrative expenditure to

21341,I am very impressed by its structure .
21342,we have already talked about it .

21369,I think it is extremely important that the European Parliament should once again discuss the situation in the
21370,"we have begun it , we are determined to bring it to a successful conclusion ."
21371,"yes , we have to be careful – Europe is in a tough competition ."
21372,while we have seen a decline in our global market share by 10 % in recent
21373,"at the same time , we have proposed a transitional arrangement on the basis of Article"
21374,that is a solid legal basis for this proposal .
21375,we have been strengthened in this regard by the political signal given at the highest political level
21376,we are pleased that Parliament 's Committee on Legal Affairs also supports the concept of the
21377,"in this context , what the Commission says about the strengthening of Europe 's voice is important"

21383,for decades they have been used for high-quality pig feed .
21384,this must also be possible in the future .

21390,"however , we have left the possibility open for Member States to show the funding , so"
21391,"I believe that we have taken a good step here , too ."
21392,the reliability of the Commission 's accounting has been heavily debated and reported
21393,the Committee on Budgetary Control was denied the opportunity to hear the arguments of the
21394,what we now read in the Court 's report - for example on pages 308
21395,a summary of these criticisms in the Court 's reports from 19

21397,the Court of Auditors and Parliament will have to deal with the review for a long time
21398,"this draft regulation is of particular importance because , together with the measures in favour of"
21399,all these funds are intended to support the implementation of the pre-accession strategy .
21400,this pre-accession strategy is about making Turkey ready for negotiations .

21402,"in view of this responsibility , you , Mr President of the Commission , in your last speech"

21431,let me now briefly refer to the various development issues that should be taken into account in future

21443,the Cotonou Agreement has led to a fundamental redefinition of the objectives of

21445,Mr Corrie has done very good work in this regard in recent years as co-chair .
21446,the result is an ambitious agreement that opens up new horizons in cooperation
21447,but it must now also be filled with concrete life .
21448,the JPA 's working methods and procedures must be made more efficient and conform
21449,"however , I also believe that when we talk about the Copenhagen criteria , we should make it"
21450,"for this reason , we should officially say goodbye to group thinking ."
21451,it is true that countries were invited to conduct bilateral negotiations in Luxembourg and then in

21455,"however , Mr Savary , the task of the universal service is to offer typical postal services"
21456,the task of the universal service is not to organize citizen care and psychological counselling
21457,"in order to make universal service possible , we are reserving a space for monopolies ."
21458,that means that we deliberately exclude competition for the exceptional purpose .
21459,"but the exclusion must only apply to postal services and not to public services , social services or"

21471,"allow me to make one more point on Category VII , Mr President ."
21472,I would like to point out that it is in fact unacceptable that the aid programme

21581,I am pleased and thankful to all those who have helped to find compromises on
21582,I would ask Members to pay attention to this when voting .
21583,there is much talk of a so-called steering committee .
21584,"a steering committee would make sense if it were a sort of executive board of this conference ,"
21585,"if you want to get a good result , the methodology must be reasonable ."
21586,working together means solidarity between the members of this group .
21587,"it also means solidarity in liability if something goes wrong , which no one expects of"
21588,"but here again , solidarity should not go so far as to create joint and several liability"
21589,this has now been successfully implemented .
21590,joint liability within certain limits - yes .
21591,"we have managed to find a good balance between the necessary solidarity , but also the"
21592,allow me to conclude with a few remarks on the DAS .
21593,the resolution proposes that a separate declaration of assurance be issued for the EAG
21594,"this is , of course , a question addressed primarily to the Court of Auditors ."
21595,the Commission takes note of the proposal with interest .
21596,a first step in this direction would certainly be a declaration of assurance for the individual
21597,this would already have been a substantial improvement of this instrument .
21598,"finally , I would like to thank the Committee on Budgetary Control for its good cooperation"
21599,"when the rapporteur says that guarantees of origin will ensure transparency , that is in full"
21600,I believe that the rapporteur has produced a good report .
21601,we should continue along these lines .
21602,"so , there is more to do than suggested ."
21603,"in this respect , I find the compromise barely acceptable ."
21604,you and the Commission must finally come to terms and look at what is available on the market .
21605,you should then submit a new proposal as soon as possible for further noise reduction - while

21608,"I am speaking as a Member of Parliament and not as the Chair , nor have I"
21609,I would ask that we keep these things separate and do not confuse the work in this way
21610,we actually have a very good atmosphere in the committee .
21611,I am a little shocked by the way things are going here tonight !
21612,I am also very grateful because it is important that we move this proposal forward quickly and
21613,thank you for your attention .
21614,"Mr President , I apologise for taking up more time , but my question has not been"
21615,has the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development transferred EUR 2 billion to EURA
21616,a yes or no is enough for me as an answer .
21617,but I wonder if we have understood the dimension of this dialogue .
21618,"in a highly divisional society , the activities of economic actors must necessarily be coordinated"
21619,I believe that coordination through the market will not work .
21620,we need political guidelines .
21621,that is why the Maastricht Treaty rightly already emphasized in Article 1
21622,only the implementation steps are missing .
21623,"unfortunately , the national governments have not wanted to take the steps to implement the directiv"
21624,we know many national governments which have seen that there is an important interdependence of effects
21625,I therefore believe it is extremely important to make it clear that coordination is intended
21626,"I know there are the famous 14 days , Mr. Purvis ."
21627,we do not agree on this .
21628,has the individualization already occurred or not ?
21629,am I not already killing ?
21630,"please , take note that people are afraid of having to kill !"
21631,"Mr President , the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy has"
21632,"Mr President , this is why the majority of my group has previously voted against an urgent"
21633,I think it is good that we have succeeded this time in activating the flexibility
21634,although the two rivals agreed the day before yesterday in Colombo to set up a
21635,agreement is needed to continue the initial positive developments .
21636,my visitor group knows that .
21637,the number of victims of violence has decreased significantly .
21638,the security situation has improved in many parts of the country .
21639,Encounters across the once hermetically closed demarcation line are increasing .
21640,"before the elections , the European Union promised to provide immediate aid to Serbia in the"
21641,"we stand there in the Word , and we will all together keep that Word ."
21642,the Commission had proposed to activate the emergency reserve for this purpose and to put together a
21643,this EUR 200 million aid package provides for the necessary measures to be
21644,"these are the expenditures for which the aid package is available , and I would like"
21645,I believe that the European Union has thus truly demonstrated that it is able to act
21646,"the summit was about think tanks , about contacts with NGOs , about new networks"
21647,we share common values .
21648,"all the more important is the observance of human rights , respect for ethnic minorities ,"
21649,"this is not a typical Western way of thinking , but must be a common democratic consci"
21650,the fight against unemployment and exclusion needs to be the same intensity as the fight against terrorism
21651,"in my country , Austria , tourism and the leisure sector are of central importance to the national"
21652,"in 1998 alone , we spent a total of 450"
21653,the value added share of the entire sector was around 13 % .
21654,I would therefore like to thank all those involved in tourism and all those who care for nature
21655,"fourthly , the discussion about the so-called fair compensation is on the one"
21656,it is absurd because the Member States interpret the term ' justice ' in such a way that
21657,then I can actually save myself the detour via the European Union .
21658,"justice in the European Union can only mean that the original objectives , namely economic development"
21659,"in the medium and long term , we need a harmonised European airspace , higher quality and"
21660,the mass redundancies that have been made in the aviation sector even before 9 /

21663,"I believe that it would be quite a good idea if we could select two pilot projects , for"
21664,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very happy ."
21665,my own occupational safety regulations are apparently not being observed today .
21666,I have to talk all the time .
21667,the second major problem with this directive is Article 9 .
21668,the purpose of this directive is to create a level playing field in Europe .
21669,"however , the result of this common position , if it were not amended , would be that"
21670,"the Americans know what is called the business judgment rule , that is , the possibilit"
21671,"in Europe , the common position provides for a strict obligation of neutrality as a matter of"
21672,so American companies can easily take over European ones in the future .
21673,the principle of this contract is simple and clear .
21674,"those who have committed genocide or war crimes , or those who have committed"
21675,it is therefore absolutely incomprehensible that the demand is made that not all criminal
21676,this demand by the Bush administration would be totally contrary to the purpose of the International Criminal
21677,"it is not only absurd , but also unacceptable for two reasons ."
21678,"we need this new social contract , we need the fight for power , money and the division of"
21679,I look around and think that the men could have helped us in this fight .
21680,"unfortunately , they are not well represented here either ."
21681,"Furthermore , I believe that there is an urgent need for transparency in the payments"
21682,"in this respect , I therefore consider this morning 's procedure to be spontaneous , per"
21683,the Charter of Fundamental Rights is also a great opportunity for Europe .
21684,why ?
21685,"firstly , because after many years , a project that has long been called for by many com"
21686,"however , it should give us some reason to think that , despite all the fine words ,"
21687,perhaps the responsible politicians in the EU have not yet found the right way to act
21688,"the reports on the delay in implementation , which the Member States have more or less"
21689,"antibiotics : why has nothing more happened , Mr Prodi ?"
21690,for months we have known that some antibiotics in animal feed are resistant to humans .
21691,I therefore call on you to do something about this now – and by the end of the
21692,pesticides – Mr Florenz has raised this issue :
21693,there are repeated reports of the dangers posed to health and the environment by obsolete
21694,we need a regulation on safety .
21695,"I , for my part , do not want to contribute to the current zeitgeist"
21696,"I am in favour of the strictest possible controls throughout the entire food production chain ,"
21697,"Likewise , we also need the strictest possible sanctions for violations ."
21698,I am now calling for BSE tests to be carried out on all animals aged
21699,the second point concerns what can be achieved in the case of Cyprus .
21700,is Turkey ready for a constructive solution in Cyprus ?
21701,"if a solution is not possible , how does it behave in the context of the enlargement"
21702,I think these are two very concrete cases for verifying credibility .
21703,"Mr President , the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which we all rightly cherish , en"
21704,"now , an impartial , fair administration that respects the interests of the citizens should"
21705,"especially in the implementation of the budget , there is a particular demand for principles such"
21706,"we are particularly committed to a competitive , open market ."
21707,why ?
21708,quite simply because we want to become more competitive in Europe !
21709,"in global competition , telecommunications are a key skill that we urgently need for"
21710,it is therefore extremely important that this be implemented as quickly as possible in the ac
21711,"we do not want differentiation , we want the regulatory authorities to make public the progress"
21712,now the following comment on the three Commission proposals and the Commission communication .
21713,my group supports the rapporteurs ' reports .
21714,it is extremely regrettable that no framework directive on the taxation of energy products
21715,"perhaps as a first step , we should agree on a kind of code of conduct to contribut"
21716,positive discrimination against air traffic must be stopped .
21717,"however , international regulation is needed here – and I fully agree with the rapporteur on this point"
21718,it would therefore be very appropriate for the Commission to submit reports to us which
21719,if the price of enlargement were the weakening or even the dissolution of the existi
21720,"it would be too high , not only for the Member States that are in it , but also"
21721,"solidarity cannot be demanded only from one side , however ."
21722,the unanswered questions about the CMO report are : how much subsidies and custom
21723,how can free competition be compatible with fair competition ?
21724,aid is subject to the aid to self-help .
21725,but the net must not be so tight that the person concerned no longer has to make any
21726,where do we draw the line between private sector and planed economy ?
21727,questions after questions .
21728,"in addition , the EU budget is tight ."
21729,but of course we also have other priorities .
21730,I agree with everyone that stability and security must be the priorities of European policy .
21731,this is also reflected in the 2003 budget : in the budget for my
21732,"there have been several requests from this House concerning the security of the external representation ,"
21733,"the aid , the increased funds for the Mediterranean region and , of course , the pre-"
21734,"there can be no doubt that this is not only about protecting these financial systems , but"
21735,"I think that a fair balance has been found here , and this is a very crucial aspect ."
21736,"nevertheless – and I have to say this again and again here , and I say it"
21737,"we could of course say that it is not our problem , and it is indeed Turkey'"
21738,"secondly , there was unanimity as regards the scope of application , namely"
21739,"we know that companies relocate to third countries for various reasons , not only economic but"
21740,that is why it is important for us to create this European transport area over time .
21741,"in this sense , a warm word of cooperation to all the institutions concerned !"
21742,"with regard to cooperation , the European Union believes that support for aid projects in Tibet"
21743,this is exactly what happened in the past with the official assurance of the Chinese authorities
21744,"I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur , Jacques F. Poos , on"
21745,"I was pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted my main demand , namely that"
21746,the most important point for me is the cultural mission of the book and society 's obligation
21747,"art and culture are , as we know , a very important economic factor , and so is the"
21748,"if we look at the printers , publishers , translators , the trade and much"
21749,"this must not mean , however , that we consider art and culture to be a purely economic"
21750,art and culture need social support .
21751,"they are a necessity , we have a responsibility to them and we cannot treat them in"
21752,"I would like to highlight one briefly , because I have had an excellent exchange of information and"
21753,"I would like to highlight just one point in the context of universal services , namely when it"
21754,we don 't give gifts here .
21755,we live in a society that takes necessary measures for solidarity and also for economic reason
21756,"what is really important is that , after many years , we are sending out very important signal"
21757,I just wanted to take this out to show you all :
21758,I trust time .
21759,but that does not cure my stomach pain .
21760,"on 5 August 1994 , the Cypriot President , Mr Klerides"
21761,this letter therefore contains the clear political commitment of the Republic of Cyprus to issue certificates
21762,"it is therefore up to the Cypriots to agree on how , in practice , Turkish"
21763,we must do something to secure the success of the democratic forces in the elections and Ko

21768,"Mr President , I have a question for the Commission so that Members of this House will be"
21769,I have here the Council common position of 9 December 1999 .
21770,the document that we have from the Council states that this common position was adopted unanimously
21771,"if I remember correctly , December 1999 was still under the Finnish Presidency"
21772,"the political agreement was reached in June 1999 , under the German Presidency of"
21773,"I am , however , somewhat confused , because the Greens in this House are claim"
21774,"I therefore wanted to ask once again whether we are really voting on this common position ,"
21775,"secondly , Korea ’ s economy is part of the global market ."
21776,new WTO negotiations are on the horizon .
21777,all this means that there is still a lot of work ahead of us .
21778,this also applies to meeting the economic criteria and the capacity to adopt the acquis .
21779,"I see a great deal of agreement with Mr Morillon 's report here , too ."
21780,"the Member States have been hesitant for a long time , and I hope , and have also"
21781,I hope that this will happen and I think it is high time .
21782,"we are already a few months behind , but we will be able to catch up ."
21783,"nevertheless , the scandals of the past are a major source of uncertainty"
21784,"I find it irresponsible , for example , when unfair pharmaceutical companies dispose"
21785,"when even sugar syrup and soft drinks contain metroxyprogesterone acetate , I"

21787,"in the area of structural policy , for example , it is becoming clear that the more"
21788,thank you for your kind approval .
21789,"in the context of development policy measures , funds will once again be specifically allocated to"
21790,"in the field of external aid , in particular , many projects are being supported that address"
21791,the reports on the aid programmes state this .
21792,"firstly , the Ludford report disregard and violate the fundamental principle of subsidia"
21793,"as I see my colleague here , our coordinator for economic policy , Othmar"
21794,he spoke about Basel II a few weeks ago .
21795,we must also be careful with Basel II not to make it more difficult for our small and
21796,but you know that too .
21797,that is not the point !
21798,"in essence , it is a completely different question ."
21799,you know very well that the consolidation successes I am talking about have not been achieved
21800,"these spending cuts have led to this positive result , but also to negative results ."
21801,public infrastructure is in many areas in a state of abandonment .
21802,"social networks are strained in many places , and we have critical strategic gaps in"
21803,"we are therefore opposed to paragraph 4 of the joint resolution , which mentions Montenegro"
21804,"of course , Montenegro also has problems with internal security , as do we in the EU ."
21805,but Montenegro is currently in serious danger and you have heard that Milosevic has now again launched
21806,here we must be careful not to give him any excuse .
21807,"therefore , yes to the fight against organised crime in solidarity , but please do not"
21808,"these are our basic positions , which , together with the tension between independence , confiden"
21809,"in the field of stem cell research , I am fundamentally opposed to embryo research that"

21818,"we have really brought to the public light in Bosnia , but also in other countries , how women"
21819,these women are particularly broken in body and soul and need reliable support .
21820,we are called upon to offer these people real security and thus not only to continue but also

21822,"in some things , that certainly plays together ."
21823,"it is certainly right to check how cooperation is organised in individual cases , but there"
21824,"now , after the end of the conflict , the immediate priority is to support KFOR"

21826,"in particular , we are responsible for the reconstruction component of UNMIG ."
21827,"the Commission 's deputy special representative , Jollie Dixon , has now taken up"
21828,this can only be achieved by banning all phthalates in toys .
21829,and we need labeling for the three to six age group .

21843,I wish the Commission every success on this path .
21844,"Mr President , I would like to support what my colleague Nuala Ahern said"
21845,"I welcome , however , the inclusion of vitamins and minerals in the category of food"
21846,"I believe , however , that the Commission should consider why foodstuffs lose so much"
21847,"I strongly advocate labelling , not only of the ingredients but also of the way in"
21848,there are vitamins that are more effective when produced naturally than when they are produced artificially
21849,I think that the consumer also has a right to know whether they have been produced by genetic engineering

21854,"the US costs its monthly commitment in Iraq 4 billion dollars , that is almost"
21855,a huge sum in view of an already huge budget deficit .
21856,that alone makes it almost inevitably clear that you have to work together here .

21896,I am often asked why we actually need such a directive .
21897,do we need to have a European plant again to answer the question of electronic waste ?
21898,the answer is relatively simple .
21899,"we have seven to eight million tonnes of scrap every year in the European Community ,"

21914,make it clear that Europe is the number one in world trade !
21915,"unfortunately , there were also serious attacks during this reconquest ."
21916,but one should not confuse cause and effect .
21917,for this reconquest Croatia was then punished by us with great love withdrawal .
21918,all aid was forbidden .
21919,"this refusal to help has also led to many wrong developments in Croatia , including wrong privat"
21920,"that is why we have asked the committee responsible to do two things : firstly , to"
21921,"if this is not possible , a revision must be provided for ."
21922,we also want Parliament to be consulted on every measure .
21923,the rapporteur and the committee responsible have followed these budgetary aspects .
21924,we thank them very much for that !
21925,"we all don ’ t think much of the watering can principle , and the pilot character projects"
21926,"I am in favour of closed loops , which are being promoted , and although"
21927,I would ask that we consider allowing exceptions not only in the Nordic countries but also
21928,"but , as I said , a lot of work still lies ahead of us ."
21929,"we should consider , in particular , the possibility of multiannual quotas and move in"
21930,this would help to ensure long-term sustainable fishing and would also give fishermen more

21934,their ongoing actions show that their voice cannot be silenced and that we therefore also

21940,since the amount of the Structural Funds was set in the financial planning for the EU

21942,Parliament 's political room for manoeuvre in the budget is thus systematically under
21943,"in the end , we are only the Council 's executive assistants ."
21944,"in our opinion , this cannot continue ."
21945,"the solution is not easy , however ."
21946,it is a fact that the forthcoming round of enlargement will put the Community to a

21948,"economical management is of course necessary , we support it and we should not ignore it"
21949,"to date , it is not clear to us how , beyond the development of prices for goods"
21950,in this area there is therefore uncertainty about the decision-making bases and the

21952,"the baby is only ten months old in monetary policy responsibility , but it must continue in"
21953,"we have tabled numerous amendments , and I believe we can say quite clearly"
21954,"on this basis , the Irish Presidency could make proposals to hold a new meeting of Head"

21956,"the establishment of central lists , which will give citizens or businesses a quick overview"

21958,"where a particular authority ceases to make documents available or to update such data , that decision should"

21962,"of the total of EUR 48 billion , EUR 6.5 billion is allocated"

21970,we really need to talk about the realities here .
21971,ensuring food safety and food quality are concerns that are crucial for the acceptance of
21972,these questions therefore also need to be considered in greater depth if we want to meet
21973,I would also like to emphasise this in the mid-term review .
21974,I call on the 15 governments to send their best people to the Convention .
21975,"there must not be people who think they are participating in a seminar , but rather personalities"
21976,if President Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing is to report to the summit
21977,"they should report to their respective national governments , because that would ensure that the Convention does not"

21980,Blurring the line between medicinal products and food supplements would lead to an unclear situation

21982,although we have succeeded in the political debate in removing the taboo on practices that
21983,"we need consistent annual reports , such as those in Mrs Avilés Perea 's"
21984,that is why my group supports the two reports .
21985,we can only fully support them and call on the Commission to implement these noble objectives
21986,"secondly , I am one of those who are concerned about the current developments in the"

21997,one point in the report and in the statements by Commission President Prodi on sustainable development

21999,"it is about eliminating environmentally harmful subsidies , especially for coal ."
22000,"I personally believe that in the long term , it must be an objective to eliminate"
22001,"I believe , however , that we must be careful to mention a very short date at this"

22005,that is only consistent .
22006,only then will we be in line with the larger set of rules of this now very advanced
22007,I would have liked to have voted in favour of the resolution on the Treaty
22008,I would like to reiterate the principles that are still valid today .
22009,"we had highlighted three main points , namely , firstly , transparency and openness"
22010,"these principles promote legitimacy , efficiency , accountability and proximity of the administration to"
22011,they also provide protection against arbitrariness and abuse of power .
22012,"they also help to detect , punish and prevent irregularities and fraud , phenomena which have"
22013,only then will it be possible to actually fulfil the legitimate demand of our citizens and those
22014,"after intensive discussions both within and across the groups , we in the Committee on Agriculture and"
22015,"our own-initiative report calls for immediate regulation at Community level , because the guidelines propose"
22016,we therefore expect the Commission to ensure that there are uniform framework conditions for a Community policy
22017,I am convinced that the most important basis for the unification of the peoples of Europe
22018,only on this basis will a united Europe have a future .
22019,Mrs Langenhagen 's speech was generally critical of the Union 's independent auditor
22020,"I would point out , however , that it is a misconception to say that the financial"

22026,"because of the shortness of time , I will only mention four problems and approaches which ,"
22027,"firstly , the 1998 reporting period was characterised by the fact that"
22028,experience has shown that we need specific strategies for the start-up and end-of
22029,we must not make the mistake of mixing up liberalisation and privatisation .
22030,"privatisation may well be an adequate means , among others , of achieving the objective"
22031,"however , I would like to emphasise the issue of the delimitation of competences"
22032,"until this issue is satisfactorily resolved , we should not create additional uncertain"
22033,support under the European initiative will continue .
22034,the call for proposals of January 2001 specifically mentions the issue of
22035,let me say a few words about whether food aid would be an alternative .
22036,food aid in the form of beef requires closed cold storage systems in the reci
22037,"you cannot just load beef on a ship and take it somewhere in a refugee area ,"
22038,you can do nothing with it .
22039,you have to consider all of that .
22040,"the experience the European Union has actually had , where the regional market was then partially destroyed"
22041,this can make a significant contribution to the rapid implementation of the internal market for financial services
22042,"however , as the consumer side has relatively few resources available , concrete measures must follow in"
22043,"otherwise , there is a fear that the instrument of the voluntary agreement – a good instrument"
22044,that alone would be too little and would not serve the cause .
22045,but it is not a panacea .
22046,it is worth looking closer .
22047,fish farming brings with it similar problems as intensive animal husbandry on the countryside
22048,"waste , parasites , chemicals , feed : these are just a few keywords ."
22049,and just to give you an example : the total annual waste from Scottish salmon farms
22050,does the Council believe that it is beneficial to stability in the world if human rights
22051,"why do we have so much trouble enforcing these clauses , for example in the"
22052,what advantages do individual governments think they will gain by delaying or undermining
22053,do you think we are doing the people of China or our relations with that country a favor by

22056,the same applies to relations with Russia and other important countries .

22070,what options have we examined to close this gap that we expect ?
22071,"firstly , we have examined the possibility of increasing the aid rate for oilseed"
22072,the disadvantage of this option is that it would reintroduce crop-specific aid
22073,"in addition , this option would require an additional funding of around EUR 1 27"
22074,the budgetary costs for this option would amount to approximately 475 million
22075,"firstly , it is clear that you have today pledged your support for parliamentary democracy in"
22076,"that is another somewhat vague term , as is governance , by the way , but"
22077,we must insist on the fact that civil society - and I think you have made this point clear
22078,"as you have said , they are the expression of the will of the people , and we will"
22079,"I hope that our proposals will be taken seriously by the governments , which are fa"
22080,even the Commission has been very cautious in its approach to payments in the preliminary
22081,"if you look at the schedules of budget implementation for headings 2 , 3"
22082,there are budget lines that have no coverage at all .
22083,if we also consider that in such a situation the Commission would first concentrate on reducing the
22084,"Madam Member , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a multilateral institution"
22085,I can assure you that I have used the last few weeks very intensively to discuss and explain
22086,"I will present the Commission with the proposal for the 2001 budget next week ,"
22087,I therefore believe that the concrete figures can really make it clear that agriculture has no
22088,"an increase in the budgetary allocation for external policies no longer seems necessary next year ,"
22089,"as Mr Wynn said , this has only to be confirmed by the World Bank study ."
22090,"the Commission wants to focus on the Mediterranean programme , not so much in terms of making new"
22091,"secondly , social security documents must be harmonised in the EU ."
22092,"we should not wait until the end of 2003 to do this , but rather"

22097,it is in all of us ' interests that these negotiations should hopefully be conclud
22098,what I find incredible is this quarrel in the Council over the export and import of

22100,"the population was properly furnished , actually only in the interest of securing the market for"
22101,nothing else happened !
22102,"now the second emotion is aroused by a very drastic announcement , by banning"
22103,"implement what we have decided , and then we will no longer need to talk about these things"
22104,this reminds me of the burning of witches in the Middle Ages .
22105,"here , guilty people are being sought who are not guilty at all ."
22106,the causes lie somewhere else .
22107,so we are giving back billions of dollars !
22108,"we can also look at Category IV , the external policy area , where almost 60 %"
22109,the rest will be lost and returned to the Member States .
22110,"a second consideration is that we should really consider whether the issue of animals , which are actually"
22111,"a positive thing to mention , despite all the criticism and all the suggestions for improvement"
22112,"on the positive side , the unemployment rate is falling and we have created 2.5"
22113,"positive aspects include the improvement in public finances and the related reduction in inflation ,"
22114,that is on the positive side .
22115,"Mr President , Commissioner Schreyer , Mr Karlsson , I am glad to see that you"
22116,"today , as President of the Court , you are presenting your annual report to the European Parliament"
22117,I would like to take this opportunity to thank you personally and the outgoing members of
22118,"at times there have been different views , but I believe that we have always worked well together and"
22119,so thank you again .
22120,today 's Court of Auditors report also shows us that we are once again making some progress
22121,I would just like to highlight a few points .
22122,"the role of the European Union must be to continue to support and promote the peace process , but"
22123,"there is no real separation of powers , there is corruption , all of this is there"
22124,that is also our task !
22125,"however , I would also like to expressly address you , Madam President-in-Office of"
22126,I believe that this internal attitude towards the future of Europe and towards cooperation between the institutions
22127,"I therefore do not quite understand why this attack on an existing contractual relationship , which"
22128,"Commissioner , I also do not understand why this is happening in a situation where the Commission know"
22129,"I am happy to hand you the study by an independent economic institute , which has found that"
22130,"in other words , in this situation , where we also know that the population is very sensitive"
22131,"however , Madam Vice-President , we are grateful to you for having , with your"
22132,on authorisation : GM food and feed will be authorised for placing on the market only
22133,"in future , the evaluation will be carried out by the European Food Safety Authority , the"
22134,"at its first reading , the European Parliament called for greater decentralisation ."
22135,we have only partially succeeded in this .
22136,one point that is important to us and which has also been adopted by the Council is that
22137,"at the European Court of Justice , the delays that have occurred in the translation service are"
22138,"this has led to an outcome that is no longer acceptable , because we now have average"
22139,that is why we will make a major contribution to reducing this translation overlap from next

22142,"Mr President , I voted in favour of this report ."
22143,the issue of the White Paper on transport is being discussed very heavily in my country
22144,the White Paper on European transport policy points in the right direction : opening up the rail market
22145,"however , the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , if they"
22146,this in turn means that the incentives for production are not decreasing but increasing and that
22147,in view of their under-representation - Mr De Rossa has pointed to this -
22148,integration is promoted .
22149,"marginal groups and socially disadvantaged people - the elderly , the unemployed"
22150,"equally remarkable are territorial employment pacts , in which cities and municipalities cooperate"
22151,social dialogues are taking place .
22152,"what is missing , however , is the targeted exchange of experiences and best practices across"
22153,let me make one more comment from a foreign policy perspective on our ad hoc group which we have
22154,I think that this ad hoc group is a good opportunity to see exactly what has happened with
22155,"we have decided not to set up a committee of inquiry which would , as it were ,"
22156,this working group will start working shortly .
22157,"this is less a problem between Parliament and the Council than between Parliament and the Commission , and we"
22158,"if the industrialised countries , and above all the 15 EU countries which can be considered"
22159,I believe that what is crucial is not so much what happens at the so-called

22162,I would like to ask whether it is right that we should be funding large projects first and
22163,"is it not rather necessary that we also be prepared to integrate small networks ,"
22164,I would like to speak in favour of this and call for us to create the financial conditions
22165,on the question of Kaliningrad .
22166,"today I found a beautiful article in my own local newspaper , the Neue Osnabrücker"

22183,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased ."
22184,"we have put these questions , firstly to obtain clarification , and secondly to get"
22185,"clarification , because it has now become clear to us Members , including through the contributions"
22186,"it has only been stated , but no justification has been given ."
22187,"if we look at the situation of the so often debated net contributors , we have to"
22188,that is between 0.3 % for my own country and 0.7 % of
22189,0.3 % for Germany !
22190,the present report was subsequently based on the Ombudsman 's recommendation to the
22191,"the old Commission did not comply with this recommendation , despite repeated requests ."
22192,this was one of the reasons why the Ombudsman adopted a special report in which
22193,the Prodi Commission has now agreed to implement the fourth recommendation addressed to it
22194,one of the Commission 's foreign policy priorities is to combat major communicable diseases
22195,"for example , in 2003 , the Commission proposes an increase of some EUR"
22196,"we must put an end to this practice , and the Commission will organise a workshop with experts"
22197,"but , frankly , it is indeed legitimate to raise the question whether these two"
22198,"no , not on a point of order , I had asked for a very , very long time"
22199,I reported myself at the same time as Mrs. Berger .
22200,my name was still in the list .
22201,I certainly wanted to take the floor .

22206,"this also means , however , that we in the European Parliament must responsibly create the conditions"
22207,"for this very reason , I cannot agree with some of the amendments which have been adopte"
22208,we therefore reject a number of amendments .
22209,stocks continue to decline .
22210,that is why sustainable fish farming is the only reasonable future perspective I can see at
22211,I would like to thank Hugues Martin .
22212,his own-initiative report on aquaculture is a particularly good example of the active approach that
22213,the Commission communication on this point highlights how Parliament can indeed raise important issues .
22214,aquaculture is undoubtedly the alternative to overfishing without prospects .

22224,"on the other hand , this does not mean that only growth is the issue , that is ,"
22225,I have already told you in my introductory remarks what the Commission is currently planning .
22226,I hope that these measures will actually improve the situation accordingly .

22244,"this is not the primary objective , of course , but it is the secondary objective"
22245,"the current economic situation makes it obvious that growth stimuli are urgently needed , and I"
22246,"I do see this initiative in connection with structural and fiscal reforms , but structural"
22247,I therefore think that this is very important .
22248,one issue will remain topical : the different approaches between some Member States and the majority of
22249,even science has not yet given a clear answer .
22250,"when extending TEMPUS III to the partner countries in the Mediterranean , special consideration must"
22251,the countries south of the Mediterranean still have very low numbers of women with higher education or higher education
22252,the reform and development of higher education structures linked to TEMPUS III should be seen
22253,"in Jordan , which , along with Malta and Cyprus , is a model country among the Mediterranean countries"
22254,"the most important thing , however , is political stability , because only then will companies settle down"
22255,we as the EU can provide the necessary assistance under our new treaty with them .
22256,"I am sure that we will do our utmost , together with the Commission , to achieve this"
22257,the key to this Intergovernmental Conference is to achieve the three-fold : capacity to
22258,only if these three things are in place will the citizens accept it in the end .
22259,"the capacity to act must , of course , be established in order to ensure the European Union'"
22260,"if we have had another debate in this House earlier today , that is an important indication"
22261,we must also be able to act in a European Union if there is a government that exercises
22262,this is an important indication that majority decision-making is a crucial prerequisite for
22263,"this is particularly important in the context of enlargement , in the area of legislation ,"
22264,"in addition , we want to expand the European Parliament 's rights in this area ."
22265,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by saying that :"
22266,I thank Commissioner Busquin for presenting this opinion .
22267,I believe that Commissioner Busquin is currently the one with the greatest responsibility in Europe .
22268,"the BSE crisis is about regaining consumer confidence , and we can only gain consumer confi"
22269,"I therefore believe that the BSE area , i.e. biotechnology and genetic research"
22270,"the success rate of LEADER I in Greece was also satisfactory , given the innovative"
22271,a final word on the delicate subject of double use or only civilian use .
22272,I do not understand the naivety of some of the amendments .
22273,the world is not only good .
22274,11 September showed this with all its cruelty .
22275,"it is our task to prepare Turkey for this path , to accompany it and to help it"
22276,"but as we have made clear , at least in our talks with all the party leaders and"
22277,the changes are in Turkey 's own interest .
22278,"they like to , and hopefully will , work better , faster and more effectively with"
22279,but we cannot take this work off Turkey .
22280,"with some tricks , selling customer data to third parties is still possible within the framework"
22281,"however , these holding conditions must be designed in such a way as to ensure the maximum degree"
22282,political decisions on animal welfare can now be made on a broad scientific basis for the various
22283,expansion and improvement of animal welfare laws should only be done with the involvement of
22284,"in an overall view of animal welfare , the natural behaviour and demands of animals"
22285,the high standards of hygiene in our society must also be met .
22286,greater consumer protection will ultimately also lead to better conditions for animal welfare .
22287,the amounts mentioned for the various countries are based on the estimated balance of payments
22288,we are dealing with comparatively modest amounts .
22289,the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund estimate that the balance of payments of the six

22291,"the shadow rapporteurs have found a new compromise on this point , and I would there"
22292,this compromise is acceptable .
22293,reform of this sector is absolutely necessary !
22294,I think you agree with me on that .
22295,we must market-orient the flax and hemp sector so that it can make an effective
22296,I remember very well our debate in Brussels the day after 11 September 20
22297,"let us remember those hours of 11 September 2001 , when for a"
22298,"this would have been a terrible vision , and that is why we say : it is good that"
22299,"we are friends , we are partners of America !"
22300,this applies to our group .
22301,given that 50 % of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given
22302,the eligible measures listed in Annex II of Line A seem to be promis
22303,"in fact , however , the Commission communication does not contain any provisions for the Member States which"
22304,"what is your view of the activities of the existing Economic and Social Committee in this context ,"
22305,I therefore strongly support the Commission 's initiative today .
22306,"at the same time , however , I must describe a big “ but ” ."
22307,this is the other step which Mrs Miguélez has also mentioned .
22308,it concerns the reform of the important advisory Committee on Fisheries .
22309,this is the basis for the dialogue .
22310,"why was the European Parliament not consulted when it came to the design , organisation and tasks"
22311,this is a deficit that we will continue to criticise .
22312,"Mr President , I would just like to briefly inform the House , in connection with yesterday"
22313,"finally , I would like to suggest that , in connection with the opening up of markets"
22314,"I believe that , of course , we can agree on reciprocal free trade with Mexico and Chile"
22315,I think that this should be more strongly included in the dialogue .
22316,"even the major languages of the European Union , such as French , which is at least a language"
22317,our former colleague Siegbert Alber once said : ' in Europe we are all minorit
22318,"but , in addition , we must of course also care for the small languages which are official languages"
22319,"Mr President , on behalf of my group , I would like to express my full support for"
22320,it is convincingly justified .
22321,"we amended the Minutes this morning , and therefore Parliament 's Minutes also state"
22322,"but I ask you , Mr President , to bring about a decision by the House ."
22323,"it is also important to strengthen the polluter-pays principle , because prices must tell"
22324,we must not bow to the lobbying interests of the agricultural and chemical industries
22325,"water is our most important resource for life , and we must ensure , through our vote , that"
22326,"closed production loops make this possible , and anything else would be a dilution of"
22327,let us seize this opportunity !
22328,"unfortunately , there is an important point that is completely missing from the debate – however often"
22329,"the right to data protection is not included in the Euro-paper , nor does it play a"
22330,I wonder where the topic is !
22331,or have the recent evidences of the global interception system “ Echelon ” already been
22332,"by including the rich cultural heritage that these countries share in this process , I am confident"
22333,"as the chairman of the European Parliament 's delegation to the South Caucasus , I consider"
22334,the joint motion for a resolution by seven political groups reflects the broad consensus among MEP
22335,I hope that the Commission will also take our concern to heart .
22336,in the new fisheries policy we also want to apply the principles of new governance
22337,the extent of the reform is best illustrated by comparing the existing policy with the
22338,"until now , the Fisheries Council has decided on TACs and quotas in December"
22339,"in addition , the existing system has not been able to effectively prevent illegal catches and"
22340,"we have centred our stock policy and its control around quotas , instead of establishing a"
22341,"on the other hand , however , the importance of women 's place in sport must also be"
22342,women are underrepresented in the decision-making bodies of sporting organisations .
22343,"why are men predominantly involved in the structures of clubs and federations ,"
22344,"in high-performance sports , this discrepancy is becoming increasingly apparent"
22345,women are not represented in decision-making bodies in professional sport in line with their achieve
22346,"on the contrary , women in high-performance sports are in a much more difficult"
22347,"the Community must act in this area , in cooperation with the relevant organisations in competitive sport"
22348,the EPP is pleased with the distinction between the work of the political groups and that
22349,we are pleased with the clear demarcation between European and national election campaigns .
22350,we welcome the clear rules governing the activities of donors .
22351,we welcome the clear criteria - both qualitative and quantitative - and the necessary dem
22352,"this is not discrimination against small groups , because a European party is only a party that is"
22353,"in this sense , I would ask everyone tomorrow to close the democratic gap that still exist"
22354,your request in paragraph 17 is already partly part of the control regulation .
22355,Member States must register imports to ensure that the TACs set by the regional fisheries
22356,if the European Union is to open up its agricultural markets to developing countries in
22357,this would achieve exactly the opposite of what the European Parliament has called for in many other
22358,if genetically modified crops are also being grown in developing countries - for example to
22359,"however , since other , much more important changes have been made to the report , I have of"
22360,but the decision on Chechnya was particularly important .
22361,two and a half months ago we made it quite clear in this Parliament that we are calling on
22362,we were strongly contradicted at the time .
22363,I am very happy that the Council is now on the same level as we in Parliament tried to
22364,the second point is the relocation of enforcement .
22365,"if we are to have a legal culture in Europe , the law must certainly be applied not"
22366,we are not discussing the fact that every piece of EU legislation is always decided on central
22367,"in this respect , it is certainly necessary , in the legislative procedure that is to"
22368,"the way to a European antitrust office should be kept open , and this will certainly be"
22369,but we need more transparency in competition policy .
22370,Parliament must be more involved and I also think that if we introduce a register in which we can
22371,I should like to revert to the appealing question raised by Mr Colom i Naval
22372,"you are , of course , right to keep referring to this issue ."
22373,in my eyes it is like this :
22374,"a revision of the financial perspective means that , while you increase something on the one hand , you"
22375,we do not have this requirement for the flexibility reserve .
22376,"in this respect , the opposition of the finance ministers to a revision of the financial perspective is"
22377,"well , you always learn something new ."
22378,this was certainly yet another example of how principles sometimes count more than budgetary intentions
22379,I would like to expressly thank the Commissioner once again for our discussion and also for making these
22380,I welcome the initiatives launched by the European Council in Laeken in December 200
22381,"I expressly welcome the Commission 's proposal and also congratulate the Commissioner , who has"
22382,there is broad agreement on this .
22383,I can also tell you - and I am pleased to do so - that there was a

22385,"now , after Parliament has adopted its decision , the Council of Transport Ministers will be called"
22386,"on behalf of all my Austrian colleagues , I therefore ask you to give"
22387,the people in the affected areas and the environment will thank us for it .
22388,"the Council has insisted on committing a clear breach of law , despite the warning"
22389,"Mr President , President Duisenberg , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to join"
22390,for this a warm word of thanks .
22391,I have always admired your open and fair way of discussing things with us in Parliament .
22392,"as regards Mr Mulder 's comment , he said that , given that the budget is"
22393,"I should like to draw attention to the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement , which stipul"
22394,"I believe , however , that we should indeed also ensure , in the supplementary budget ,"
22395,"I am also convinced that if we can agree on what is necessary and right , we"
22396,it is certainly easier to make pragmatic decisions in individual cases than in general
22397,"this applies in particular to the principle of subsidiarity , but certainly also to the"
22398,"instead of arguing about general principles in abstract terms , we should rather consider the necessit"
22399,we know that everyone here has his own opinion .
22400,I would urge that we should be reasonable and prudent in this matter at first reading and
22401,"thirdly , I would like to have my newspaper quickly in the morning ."
22402,there is no newsstand nearby .
22403,I still haven 't found the newsstand .
22404,I always ask someone who knows where the newsstand is to bring me one .
22405,"after our full support , we now expect the Council to take action ."
22406,we have provided the advance .
22407,it is now up to the Council to come forward .
22408,"until then , we will support the rapporteur 's proposal on Europol to reject"
22409,"lastly , as the rapporteur has mentioned , burden sharing has once again come into"
22410,I am saying quite openly that burden sharing is worthy of criticism and that anyone
22411,"but no one is reducing too much , all Member States are reducing too little ."
22412,"the scientists are telling us quite clearly that if we want to stop climate change ,"
22413,and if we assume that the industrialised countries must reduce by more than 50 % in
22414,I therefore particularly support the call for the Commission to provide the necessary resources to continue
22415,we need to learn more about these previously unknown diseases and epidemics in order to be

22417,"people are eating meat again , and they are buying cheaply again ."
22418,"Mr President , I do not want to say anything about my report on the Czech Republic or about"
22419,"if you have read it , you will also see that the criticism that came from the right"
22420,a lot has been said about this .
22421,"agenda 2000 , an ambitious reform project , was to be implemented"
22422,not all the decisions taken at the Berlin Summit were as forward-looking as we had
22423,"good compromises , for example in the financial area , which provide reserves for enlargement to"
22424,"here , the opportunity for a policy towards ecological sustainability , which strengthens regional structure"
22425,"not least , the escalation in Kosovo marked the German Presidency of the Council ."
22426,"as you know , the decision to intervene militarily to combat a policy of racism ,"
22427,"the German Presidency of the Council , however , contributed with great commitment to pushing"
22428,now it is important to strengthen the region with targeted reconstruction aid in order to

22434,employee participation in the sense of Lisbon is more !
22435,neither the need for security of the Israeli population nor the demand of the Palestinian population for a
22436,the humanitarian situation in particular is a cause for great concern .
22437,it is the unanimous opinion of international observers on the ground that the current humanitarian
22438,it is simply unacceptable that EU-funded aid missions are refused or
22439,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is the first time I have spoken in"
22440,I am therefore particularly pleased to be able to speak on the subject of South Africa
22441,with regard to the harmonisation of fines and penalties for transport companies that transport third
22442,"we therefore voted against the minimum penalties provided for , without , however , calling into"
22443,"the Bonn Conference was not a failure , even though the dramatic situation would have required greater"
22444,"in Bonn , I was particularly positively surprised by the constructive role that the"
22445,many in the business world are recognising that commitment to climate protection also offers economic opportunities
22446,"nevertheless , there is still a lot to be done before the all-decisive"
22447,but the Council has not only refused to negotiate with us on such a possible revision
22448,that is just the gross cuts I have mentioned .
22449,so that 's not how it works !
22450,Parliament will stick to its traditional priorities .
22451,"we will provide adequate funds for our budget lines on democracy and human rights , on cooperation"
22452,we accept the Council 's level of funding for MEDA and call on it to join
22453,"the central priority for the 2001 budget must , as before , be to"
22454,this does not mean – and I would like to emphasise this once again – financing
22455,"what we want , however , is a strategic impulse which will quickly enable small and medium"
22456,such a strategic initiative will ensure international competitiveness and development and thereby strengthen the enter
22457,"I am pleased that we are in agreement with the Council on this point , and I am"
22458,"I have not only criticised the Commissioner , we are always doing our best to please oursel"
22459,"not my group , we have always tabled the appropriate amendments ."
22460,"perhaps , Mr Jarzembowski , the PPE will join us next time , and"
22461,"of course , we must also consider in the context of this discussion that there are very special regions"
22462,"the programme for border regions which the Commission has put in place , I am sorry , Commissioner ,"
22463,maybe you should think about whether you can do something similar …
22464,other important points include : promoting the creation of biotechnology clusters and other technology transfer
22465,"of the 68 amendments , the Commission can accept 6 amendments in"
22466,a list of the requests concerned has been submitted to the Bureau .
22467,"in addition to the very important question of how to help the poorest developing countries , the"
22468,"in this context , I would like the G8 Summit to express the wish to create an international"
22469,this is all the more important at a time when a summit topic that has not been on
22470,I very much hope that the optimism of the Heads of Government gathered there will help
22471,"secondly , one can of course ask , if someone from Denmark buys a car in Germany"
22472,but that is another story .
22473,we want the directive as soon as possible .
22474,the second important issue is the voluntary nature of the system .
22475,the Commission proposal leaves it up to the Member States to decide whether or not to set up
22476,"we should not forget , however , that European pigmeat production takes very different forms"
22477,"for this reason , there are a number of Member States , but also pigmeat producers"
22478,"to conclude , while we are singing a hymn to free trade here , in Geneva"
22479,the draft declarations that have been made so far are completely unacceptable to us and
22480,"health , culture and education are even being sacrificed to the free market ."
22481,"Mr President , Mr Posselt , I am very grateful for this question , because it"
22482,I can also inform you that since the accession process was launched more than ten years ago by
22483,"I am also in favour of greater legal certainty , which is why we are in"
22484,the distribution of costs among several polluters must be clarified .
22485,I am very grateful to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for its

22487,"I would like to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Manders and Mrs Niebler , for their"
22488,these criteria must also include taking account of the interests of consumers and not just of
22489,the quality of service should be guaranteed by means less restrictive than charging .
22490,it is therefore not sufficient that a fee agreement has been authorised or confirmed by
22491,"it must also lead to a permanent ceasefire on both sides , which is respected"
22492,as long as this crisis is still ongoing and the peace process is not sufficiently advanced
22493,we will not go there as long as the situation there is as it is now .
22494,we hope that this will be possible at a later date .
22495,"a second issue : in the European Union , several states – Great Britain , Austria as well –"
22496,the majority of the citizens and consumers of the European Union want this for the European Union .
22497,I believe that the WTO will have to accept that it is quite possible to have a successful

22499,this last point will be addressed by drawing up guidelines on best practices in consulta

22501,"we should strengthen learning to argue critically , strengthen self-confidence in the"
22502,"these points , these competences , will become increasingly important alongside the instrumental competence path"
22503,it has been rightly said - and I would like to point out this once again :
22504,sustainable development is under threat .
22505,it is true that a holistic strategy is necessary .
22506,"it is not only a matter of medical care , but we are now facing a phenomen"
22507,"but it is not curable , and that means that prevention must also be started here ."
22508,prevention is an important field that must be included in such a holistic health system .
22509,we must always bear in mind that this report is only a preparatory measure and that the Water
22510,"fourthly , the approach of urgent regulation of content and infrastructure must be maintained ."
22511,"in my country , the draft law on the media authority KOMMAUSTRIA is an exemplar"
22512,we have to meet the pace and must not take any more time !
22513,"Commissioner , we know that this was not an exceptional case ."
22514,the problem with this budget surplus - as we call it - is that the longer the period
22515,so there is something wrong with the system itself .
22516,"if we do not tackle this issue now , when will we do so ?"
22517,it is not the case that the Council thinks that this system of privileges and immunities
22518,he explicitly confirmed this only last year when the uniform voting rights were introduced
22519,"this is obviously a permanent solution for the Council and it cannot , of course , be accept"
22520,"accordingly , the necessary resources for this task must be anchored in the budgetary"
22521,the Council 's decision on the financial perspectives for 2000-20

22527,living in monetary union also means counting on a well-functioning cross-border payment

22722,one point that still seems important to me in order to make the eco-audit practicable
22723,a one-year period is proposed for the renewal of validation .
22724,I think that is definitely too short .
22725,the companies have three quarters of a year to prepare an environmental report .
22726,this cannot be done if validation is required every year .
22727,I therefore propose two or three years and hope you will agree .

22729,the candidate countries are on the doorstep .
22730,some countries have done exemplary work in terms of hygiene and health protection .
22731,but there are still massive problems until an adequate standard can be achieved .

22787,"I would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , to vote in favour of this report"
22788,we can send a signal here again that Parliament is active in preventing mismanagement and especially
22789,let me briefly touch on a second area .
22790,most of those who have been involved in the directive so far are lawyers .
22791,"we all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty , some of them very old"
22792,we know that this directive is based on EC law and not on EU law .
22793,"but before the elections , we – the Council , the Commission , Parliament , the press , trade"
22794,we have made the change from EEC to EC to EU acceptable to the citizen
22795,he has now understood the EU .
22796,we are doing ourselves and the citizens no good if we now call the product we are
22797,"the citizen is interested in the EU world , it is valid for him ."
22798,I would ask the Council and the Commission to move in this direction .
22799,"what is at stake here is the method by which the controls , inspections and investigations"
22800,"I believe that we must take into account the fact that the freedom of the individual Member , even"
22801,"this is the classic principle of freedom of mandate , which has been fought for for cent"
22802,only in this way can the Member exercise control .
22803,"he must have the right to refuse to testify , and that without any ifs or"
22804,"we have it now , but application methods partly override it ."
22805,"indeed , only if a Member has this right of refusal can he keep information to himself"
22806,"only then can we exercise control over the executive in the sense of Parliament , and we should not"
22807,let me just mention some of the new elements .
22808,"firstly , the quotas have been substantially adjusted to bring the fishing opportunities into"
22809,"there is no quota for cod , redfish in western waters and for blue whiting to"
22810,so there is no paper fish anymore .
22811,"however , in addition to legal changes , it is necessary that real changes take place on the"
22812,"ultimately , we must not measure the human rights situation in Turkey by what is written on paper"
22813,prosecutors and judges have an important role to play in this .
22814,"the Commission offers Turkey a number of training programmes in this area , which are also being used"
22815,"firstly , unfortunately , we still have a situation in this region where human rights and"
22816,that is a fact .
22817,our first objective must therefore be to help where we can and where we see the will
22818,"only if lawyers do the same as banks , namely manage assets and money ,"
22819,this is one of the few proposals which affects every citizen of the European Union
22820,"if you pay with a credit card , you are affected by the policy when you lease"
22821,"at the moment , there are contracts worth about one trillion euros in consumer credit agreements"
22822,it is therefore of the utmost importance that Parliament deals with this matter with the ut
22823,this is mentioned in both reports because it is important that participation in the European economic
22824,another important point is the involvement of the European Parliament .
22825,its deliberations can provide further transparency and enhance the political and democratic profile of the relationship
22826,the Öcalan case – I mean the death penalty – raises the question of how we
22827,"there can be only one answer to this from all the political directions in this House , and"
22828,it is not a question of making Öcalan an angel of peace .
22829,"it is more about showing that respect for human rights is much more than empty words ,"
22830,these widely welcomed commitments were the inevitable response to the declared willingness of most
22831,they can therefore be considered as part of the implementation of the statements contained in
22832,those who criticise the Kyoto Protocol in principle – there were some Members of this
22833,"in Germany , there is experience with such preventive restrictions of fundamental rights ."
22834,"the radicals decree did not accuse the people concerned of illegal acts , but"
22835,if I am today removing data on right-wing radicalism from the Internet and lose
22836,"on this paper there is still data protection , although there is no longer any ."
22837,the only question that remains open is what title the Council 's planned initiative to

22839,I believe that one of the most important points in this regard is also the inclusion of trade

22841,"however , this will not prevent the need for appropriate controls , and this regulation is"
22842,that is why monitoring measures will be extremely important .
22843,this network of Member States ' supervisory authorities is needed and we hope that it will be

22845,it must be ensured that the abolition of the ratification procedure for certain policy areas does
22846,this can be ensured by a proposal tabled by some of my fellow Members and
22847,"we are calling on the European Union , across all parties , to offer itself as a mediator"
22848,the Council is to appoint a special representative for Nepal .
22849,I hope that the Commission shares this position .

22864,"this is precisely the prerequisite for stabilizing the European social model , but also"
22865,"Mrs Schierhuber , the Commission has not changed its opinion ."
22866,the Commission has presented this proposal as a consequence of the experience of recent years .
22867,"we have just discussed a report on combating fraud , and this is something that is directly"
22868,I can only say once again that if the question of the distribution of areas is discussed again
22869,"as the Commissioner for Budgets , I must say that a budget-neutral solution must be"
22870,"it cannot be that we agree on principles here and then , when it comes to implementation"
22871,"I would like to make a side note to the government of my country , which simply wants"
22872,I think it is good that the Commission is remaining strict in this respect .
22873,the traditional policy of our Parliament is to defend existing programmes .

22882,"if you tell us today how you intend to proceed , we would be greatly assist"
22883,"I am in favour of anonymity , that is , that no names are mentioned ,"
22884,our main concern is to gain insight into possible prospects for monetary policy .

22886,"Fifthly , it makes sense to deal with controversy ."
22887,today ’ s taboos can be tomorrow ’ s viable compromises .

22891,"the EU will , however , be able to obtain a majority with the proposal for a permanent"
22892,so beyond Seattle there is reason for hope .
22893,"I would like to make it clear , however , that we are guided here by the principle"
22894,"in order to respect these two principles , I think it is acceptable that some steps take"
22895,"nevertheless , I believe that the success proves us right ."
22896,"in the last ten years alone , the Community has claimed and recovered almost EUR"
22897,these figures speak for themselves and need no further explanation .
22898,interested citizens will continue to see European summits as a political opportunity to express their ideas
22899,politics and governments must no longer ignore the minds and hearts of the citizens .

22901,"this is , of course , a political priority , but it is only about a few posts"
22902,it is not budgetary .
22903,internal affairs and justice policy does not have any budgetary impact .
22904,you have to look at this in a sober way .
22905,"we should therefore distinguish between politically important issues , which include the internal and justice policy"
22906,"but for the budgetary guidelines , this is not the top priority , because it is"
22907,"in this context , I would like to say a final word to Mr Markov :"
22908,"Mr Markov , I have already criticised the weakness of the West and the re"
22909,I was already of the opinion that democrats should not compromise with totalitarian forces .
22910,"that was true then , it is true today , and it will be true in the future as"

22912,this also shows you that there cannot be a zero value for dioxin .
22913,dioxin is a ubiquitous substance that is found everywhere in the world and un
22914,what we have to prevent is that substances containing dioxins are added or can enter
22915,"I also believe , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , that it is irresponsible for"
22916,that cannot be a concept .
22917,"thirdly , if you are now going to conduct controls for nitrophene again – as"
22918,"the right to asylum is laid down in different treaties , and different definitions and"
22919,this is obviously contrary to the principles and objectives of the EC Treaty
22920,the creation of a uniform asylum law and harmonised implementing rules is therefore a
22921,"I would like to admit one thing , however : what we have seen here is further proof"
22922,this is particularly true in the area of agriculture .
22923,"the Czech Republic still has time to fully implement the acquis communautaire , but one could have"
22924,I do not need to tell you about the concerns of the people in the surrounding areas
22925,it could be that the whole thing takes place already next week .
22926,I think that the European Parliament should also express its opinion on this .
22927,my heart is a little split .
22928,"I am Austrian and , of course , as a European from the neighbouring area"
22929,I do not think you will find anyone else who knows the reality of the Roma in
22930,I do not leave a visit to these countries without dealing directly with this problem on the ground
22931,"I am not doing this because I believe that by visiting a Roma settlement , a Roma school"
22932,"I want people in these countries to see on their television screens that the Commission , when it"
22933,"on the subject of human rights , I am therefore happy to add another report , the one"
22934,"I would like to see even more country-specific details for the next report , for example ,"
22935,one could also offer to omit the mention in such discussions if the matter is cleared
22936,"you can be flexible in the form , but not in the substance !"
22937,I believe that this upward quality grading would be very important for consumers and citizens .
22938,the committee has recognised Mrs Palacio 's professional qualifications by a large majority .
22939,the committee has confirmed that the priorities which Mrs Palacio has set out in writing and o
22940,the committee was also largely satisfied with Mrs Palacio 's answers to the Socialist
22941,Mrs Palacio has convincingly explained that the Spanish Parliament 's committee of inquiry has

22943,we look forward to working with Mrs Palacio .
22944,but thank you again for the support of the Danish Presidency and the Commissioner .
22945,I hope that 3 December will be a day for this sector that will bring that !
22946,what the three legal services are unanimously saying is therefore exactly what the Council is
22947,it is obvious that we cannot participate in this !
22948,a second complex I would like to mention is that of budget surpluses - Mr McCartin
22949,the discrepancy between estimated and actual payments in 2001 for the
22950,"in addition , the payment estimates submitted by the Member States to the Commission are often very"
22951,one positive thing is that there is now a written programme from the Turkish Government setting out the steps
22952,"it only has to make it , because paper alone is patient ."
22953,there must be changes in this area .
22954,"the changes also concern the National Security Council , which , according to this proposal , is now to"
22955,I would like to formulate a few of the expectations we have of the Intergovern

22957,this is technically possible .
22958,"it is not a matter of a multitude of articles that would have to be disputed ,"
22959,"secondly , the Intergovernmental Conference must leave Nice behind ."
22960,the Heads of State or Government who led this Union into the impasse of Nice must now

22962,they talk without a microphone .

22965,a final comment on European defence .
22966,I had the pleasure of being chairman of the European Parliament 's Subcommittee on
22967,we want a North Atlantic Alliance that is based on the European pillar and the American pillar
22968,"this is not directed against America , but we want to complement each other , we want to"
22969,"at its core , it is about us defending our common values together ."
22970,this is the basis of a common European defence policy .
22971,we must apply the polluter pays principle correctly .
22972,"I see a problem in some places , because in the case of historical waste in particular , it"
22973,"you have to be careful , because not in all areas there is also market transparency ."
22974,we have heard that in committee .
22975,"I have been particularly concerned about the living room lights , as an example of this problem"
22976,"manufacturers say , with some right , that it is not the polluter pays principle if a cha"
22977,"this is not the polluter pays principle , it is the exact opposite !"
22978,if we also consider that many of these are grey imports from companies that do not adhere
22979,I therefore ask for support for Amendments Nos 65 and 88 .
22980,the new WTO round may lead to a further boost to globalisation and will provoke fear
22981,we must make it clear that everyone benefits from open world trade .
22982,"in this context , it is particularly important to achieve better integration of developing countries into"
22983,the Socialist Group expressly supports the Commission 's approach to link globalisation and sustainable
22984,only in this way will the foundation of world trade be shaped in a more balanced and
22985,"unfortunately , our proposal in committee – the automatic award of the Ecolabel to products and"
22986,it would have been an opportunity to spread the European label even faster and better .
22987,an important concern is the involvement of non-governmental organisations and associations .
22988,it is essential that expertise and the awareness of consumer interests be incorporated into the

22995,"I think the Council should be clear that this method of the supplementary budget , which aims to"
22996,an important criterion must be that the legal framework conditions are practicable .
22997,"in particular , they must be in line with WTO rules and not burden the development of"

23000,"Mr President , I thank you for welcoming local politicians who have to implement what is being"
23001,but we have to do our work first .
23002,I would like to draw attention to the fact that this morning not all the language versions of the

23005,our aid under the development funds is reaching its limits because it is aimed at
23006,"there is often no public administration that functions even halfway , there is no democratic control"
23007,"secondly , Mr Poettering , the following :"
23008,I did not report the last time I was in Brussels .
23009,you have said something in Brussels that is very dangerous .
23010,you said that this group has taken action against Austria .
23011,do you know who argues like that ?
23012,"there is only one person who argues in this way , and that is Jörg Haider"
23013,""""
23014,"human rights are being trampled underfoot in an extremely brutal way , as the OSCE"
23015,"at that time too , we took a long time to adjust to reality , and later said ,"
23016,we should avoid that this time !

23021,"secondly , European environmental and health policy , minimum social standards and development policy should remain central"
23022,"thirdly , the multifunctionality of the European agricultural model , namely further development"
23023,"Madam President , there has been criticism here that the Austrian Member of the European Commission ,"
23024,"I would like to say that this event was excellent , that the Austrian Commissioner , Mr F"

23028,"in the field of agriculture , the Commission 's preliminary draft is more than EUR"
23029,"I would like to emphasise once again that this is , of course , a very good"
23030,"secondly , I find it completely incomprehensible that the German Chancellor , for example"
23031,this very grand and very little concrete appearance contradicts the decisions of the G8

23033,"what it might have been about , it could only be speculated about ."
23034,by maintaining the controversial Annex XV in the Accession Treaty and thereby
23035,I would remind you that two major European scientific institutions are in Latin America : the ESO

23037,"something like this has started with Mercosur , could be extended to the whole of"
23038,allow me to make one final comment :
23039,"Mr Swoboda , who will speak next , and I will be speaking about the railway"
23040,"we are opening up the markets , but for that we need interoperability ."
23041,"these are two sides of the same coin , and I therefore hope that the Council will"
23042,"on the question of ship classification , colleagues know that I am not so happy with"
23043,"we do not have a ceiling , but we do have a review clause ."
23044,I trust that the Commission will report after three years and present us with new proposals on how

23050,that all that is being done to the Austrians is just bilateral policy is simply not true .
23051,anyone who needed confirmation of this fact has received it today from the President of this House
23052,how else can we understand the statement by Nicole Fontaine that she hopes that Austria will
23053,what are we now ?
23054,let us therefore refrain from hypocritical corrections to Articles 6 and 7
23055,let us adhere to the law in force and deal with the Austrians in the way
23056,"let us not exclude , but let us include !"
23057,"at first reading , the European Parliament called for a substantial increase in the financial resources , which"
23058,the Commission and the Council have accepted all our amendments except this one .
23059,I can only deeply regret this short-sightedness .
23060,European statistics are becoming more important in an increasingly complex world and in the increasingly
23061,since Eurostat would not have the money to start this programme on 1 January 20

23064,I know that Parliament strongly supports this approach and shares the Commission 's satisfaction with
23065,"for the BAT , the area of foreign policy plays the greatest role ."
23066,"my colleague Chris Patten , together with the other Commissioners responsible for foreign policy"
23067,the energy source mix will have to appear on the bill every year in future .
23068,"this means that I , as a consumer , will simply take advantage of the right to choose"
23069,I believe that this is a major step forward for us all and that transparency will of course

23071,these are the requirements that the citizens of Europe rightly expect of us .
23072,"we have received a proposal from the Commission in this regard , in accordance with the directive"
23073,the question is to check how much monopoly is needed to ensure these conditions – in particular the
23074,I have always been of the opinion that this is how we should proceed with the postal services
23075,I think that is a consideration that should be further explored .
23076,I am very sorry that the many studies that the Commission has carried out in recent years on
23077,that would have made the rapporteur 's work a little easier and certainly that
23078,"thus , everyone could draw what he considered right from the multitude of studies that are now"
23079,"in addition , in connection with the Takeover Directive , there is an urgent need to adopt"
23080,this has been in the draft since 1972 and has not been adopted

23089,this is left to the Member States .
23090,"Furthermore , there is no outline of the obligations , liability standards and"
23091,what do I mean by that ?
23092,"it would be important if we could make it clear that certain economic , employment or environmental decision"
23093,European economists regretfully note that this is not the case to date .
23094,"this brings me to my third point , which is what we have before us ."
23095,I am concerned that the common foreign and security policy is becoming more and more competent
23096,"the fact that we are withdrawing from Latin America , Asia and Africa , and especially Latin"
23097,"so , talking more about foreign policy and less about international solidarity , that will not fit in"
23098,we must change this .
23099,this cannot be done in the budget at the expense of other regions of the world in the

23101,the points to be clarified are known .
23102,"the general interest service is subject to the subsidiarity principle , but it is part of the"
23103,delays will not resolve the issues .
23104,we can keep to the timetable because the outstanding issues are on the table .
23105,"secondly , I would like to thank all those people who are working here ."
23106,this is not exactly the way to reform European administration .
23107,I would like to call on you to put an end to this nonsense immediately and
23108,I believe it is important that the Community initiative can start in time and that the report receive

23117,this is only possible if the hurdles to getting from committee to plenary are raised .
23118,this is absolutely imperative .
23119,what Richard Corbett and the committee are proposing is going in the right direction .
23120,we may have to go a little further in the future .
23121,we Liberals have always been in favour of strengthening controls in view of the high

23123,"Mr. Deprez , I would like to say that I am not sure of the question ."
23124,I am willing to admit that the Commission cannot know everything .
23125,the difficulty is that we do not have an acquis here which would allow us to have a

23128,I have no problem at all with taking the phone in such a case and calling the Prime Minister

23138,I hope that we will now reach a compromise .
23139,it is important that no one who wants to take advantage of the possibility of mo

23143,the current reporting and debate sometimes gives the impression that only the current net contributors are pa
23144,that is wrong .
23145,"all the current Member States are paying the same relative amount for enlargement , that is ,"
23146,but here an equal solidarity performance is required .
23147,"in absolute terms , of course , this means that , given the different national product and the different"
23148,"but it is a joint , solidarity-based achievement and , of course , the financial"
23149,"however , we must not forget that this debate is not about whether or not to build a"
23150,"it is about the question of stabilizing democracy , the rule of law and peace in Europe ."
23151,these are values of inestimable value .
23152,but what happens ?
23153,two camps are formed .
23154,"on the one hand , the European Union , which is looking for the shortcomings in the"
23155,"on the other hand , there are the Member States , who would like to transfer problems to Europe"
23156,"Commissioner , you have worked hard to ensure that these laws are implemented in a targeted"
23157,"but it is not that simple , and we have sometimes criticised your methods ."
23158,I can partially understand that you acted in this way .
23159,"unlike the governments at the Nice Summit , we , as Europe 's directly elected"
23160,"the double voluntary approach would otherwise make the Commission 's proposal , which is in principle"
23161,"after the Commission put forward its proposals last week , Parliament will do so this week ."
23162,"many Members wanted to go much further , even calling for the drafting of a European Constitution"
23163,we have disciplined ourselves and remained within the broad framework of the institutional
23164,it is now up to the governments to have the insight and the courage to adopt
23165,"I would not have made these statements a few weeks ago , because the Council 's common"
23166,"tomorrow , however , you will have before you for vote the result of an intensive and"
23167,ten compromises reached with the Council in an informal conciliation on Amendments Nos
23168,this document shows that the Council and Parliament have really come closer to each other .
23169,how can the will of the European citizens be expressed if not through parties ?
23170,"as different as our views may be , it is the parties that ultimately express the political will"
23171,this is why the importance of this statute for political parties for the unification of our continent
23172,it may well be that if we now use a Leader-like programme to activate the organisation

23174,"and we might have the chance , through such a programme , to let all the money that has"

23176,"it must be comprehensive , seek to balance the benefits worldwide and be convincing to"
23177,market participants must have as free access as possible to all markets in the world .
23178,the rules governing it must be fair and based on the mutual granting of benefits and

23199,I do not agree with this decision .

23208,"we welcome the establishment of such a forum , but just as such a forum complements"

23222,may I perhaps say one more thing in closing – I know that time is running out
23223,"the media has been called upon , we cannot force them to report ."
23224,that 's right .
23225,but we must place emphasis on serious reporting .
23226,"for example , the winner ’ s finish line with the melody “ Sexy Thing ” was"
23227,the image was zoomed into the corresponding places and parts of the women ’ s bodies

23236,"if not , we would have to tell the Council that it is not acceptable for the Council"
23237,"in that case , we would have to think about the budget and the financing of the system"
23238,you can be sure that we would do that !
23239,"I do not think that such an agreement is a futile endeavour , but on the"
23240,I also believe that human rights organisations and non-governmental organisations should be more
23241,"we would like to call on the Russian Government very clearly , firstly , to investigate"
23242,I also regret the fashionable lack of economic thinking .
23243,"if financial markets are more lucrative than economic investment , then the problem of unemployment will remain"
23244,I therefore urge my fellow Members to support the amendment on this matter
23245,there are three points in Mr Karas ' excellent report that are important to me .
23246,"firstly , coordination between economic policy , employment policy and social integration must be improve"
23247,"the guidelines , which are to be adopted annually , are key elements for coordinating"
23248,"it is regrettable , however , that many Member States agree on the objectives but la"
23249,"on behalf of the Commission , I would like to say the following about the individual amend"
23250,"firstly , several amendments in the report aim to include all the reports and"
23251,the Commission is in favour of such a streamlining of procedures .
23252,"finally , I hope that any system that is introduced will not lead to the situation we"
23253,thousands of hours of work by truck companies were sacrificed to install systems that the country
23254,"because that cannot be the point and purpose and in my eyes it completely misses the target ,"
23255,"all of us in the European Union , but also UNMIK , must now act quickly there ."
23256,"UNMIK must ensure that there is a legal framework in place to arrest , put behind bar"
23257,"but there is also the problem of missing Serbs in Kosovo , which we all know about ."
23258,we appeal to the Kosovo Albanians to speak now and to inform the Red Cross if they know
23259,this procedure seems to have been found in the commission of the President of the European Court of Human
23260,I must say in this connection that it is regrettable that no timetable has been drawn
23261,that would have made things easier .
23262,"it is very regrettable that , even before this body has started its work , the future President"
23263,the prerogatives of the budgetary authority shall be respected .
23264,the budgetary authority shall authorise the subsidy to the Agency 's administrative appropri
23265,the establishment plan of the Agency shall be submitted to the budgetary authority in the
23266,it is also proposed to raise the tax rate on diesel to that of unleaded
23267,"as our rapporteur has already said , this is completely absurd ."
23268,in view of the Commission ’ s unfortunately intransigent attitude towards the amend
23269,the adoption of the law on minority languages in official communications was an important step in
23270,this brings national law into line with the applicable international standards and complies with the
23271,"the European Summit is right to focus on economic reforms , well-functioning markets and"
23272,it is therefore to be welcomed that the summit was not just a summit on
23273,"the Commission regrets that the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General , Mr Kofi Anna"
23274,the Commission has given its full support to this process and recalls the European Union 's
23275,a second step must then be the increase in added value through exports .
23276,"the area of know-how in particular , in which some Member States already have some strong companies"
23277,but that would benefit everyone .
23278,municipalities and consumers save costs .
23279,producers find new markets .
23280,"I believe that exporting water , just as other countries export their gold in the form of oil"
23281,"I think we are also entitled to expect that the proposed codes of conduct , which"
23282,I think that the provisions we have adopted on the liability of providers can also
23283,I can only hope that this will prove to be successful and that we will not have to make
23284,"no , ladies and gentlemen , we do not want the patenting of all software in"
23285,we do not want to strengthen the market power and monopolies of software giants .
23286,"no , we do not want to jeopardize the business bases of small and medium-s"
23287,and we don 't want to damage the successful open source movement and Linux technology in any way
23288,what do we want ?
23289,we want to make a reasonable distinction between computer-controlled technical inventions on
23290,the Commission 's Legal Service apparently has a different view .
23291,now he has been given a lesson by the court .
23292,"however , following the Court 's decision , we are now in a situation of inequality ,"
23293,"this situation cannot continue until , perhaps in two years , a decision is taken on the merit"
23294,I have therefore used Rule 181 of the Rules of Procedure and
23295,"Furthermore , former Hadep leader Murat Bozlak and current leader Ahmet Turan Demir were"
23296,"the reason was that Hadep supports and helps the PKK , which has chosen peace"
23297,"the paper is very general , but it is important ."
23298,"the internal market itself is also a very good thing , which has taken us a great deal"
23299,"therefore , there is indeed room for improvement in internal market policy ."
23300,"the key issue for this Intergovernmental Conference , however , is to achieve enlargement capacity"
23301,"it must therefore be clear that , with the exception of constitutional issues , everything will be"
23302,"in addition , there is something that Olivier Dupuis has clearly mentioned ."
23303,"there may be different opinions about the way and the goal , but we should agree on the"
23304,we can no longer avoid the question of the future of Kosovo !
23305,the Commission welcomes the fact that some of the candidate countries are already taking steps to create structure
23306,"for example , a Polish OLAF has been decided in Poland and is to be set up ."
23307,I therefore sincerely ask the Council to merge the headquarters of the Stability
23308,we don ’ t need to reinvent the wheel when people have been working on it for years
23309,I therefore ask you to support me in order to ensure that this agency is effective .
23310,"I was very pleased , Mr President-in-Office , that you mentioned Russia ."
23311,"we need good relations with Russia , but we know that the most serious human rights violations are"
23312,"as Christian and European Democrats , we say that the life of a peaceful Muslim in Chech"
23313,we must defend human dignity everywhere on this earth .
23314,the final report of the Baia Mare Task Force confirmed the need for these measures .
23315,this task force was set up by Mrs Wallström to obtain more information about the accident in
23316,"in your report , you welcome this communication and support the Commission 's general approach to establishing"
23317,"this applies not only to the three key actions I have just mentioned , but also to"
23318,"in this respect , we need very strict regulations for these areas , which will transfer the technology"
23319,you can ’ t do that overnight .
23320,that is also quite clear .
23321,we are all realists and we are all giving manufacturers the right to a certain transitional
23322,but we need the technological implementation so that leisure activities produce as little exhaust

23324,"it is part of the tensions that also underlie the concept of European integration , solidarit"
23325,despite the fact that a large number of the European Parliament 's amendments have been
23326,I would like to draw attention to the fact that this directive is in the interests of
23327,I would be a fool if I were to punish these countries and say that they must adopt
23328,"of course not , they are supposed to achieve the objectives , and if they achieve"
23329,"Commissioner , if you say that national aid is important , then I would like to say that"
23330,tobacco has just been mentioned by the members of the Committee on the Environment .
23331,the Committee on Agriculture has also taken up tobacco again .
23332,we are absolutely dissatisfied with the fact that the funds of the Tobacco
23333,we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are also tired of rubbing ourselves
23334,"on the one hand , there are the demands for health education , on the other hand ,"
23335,but you have to see the reality .
23336,as long as we have farmers who grow tobacco – and they are not the richest
23337,"therefore , the possibility of alternatives must not only be investigated more intensively in"
23338,"democracy , understood correctly , means nothing more than that people who want to act together"
23339,this is not contradicted by the fact that these people have very different interests and that
23340,what is the situation in the European Union ?
23341,"on the subject of inflation , according to current forecasts , the rate of price increase"
23342,"however , external factors such as the rise in oil prices play an important role in this development"
23343,"in this context , I welcome the establishment of an independent European Food Agency ."
23344,"ultimately , we will all benefit from it together ."
23345,"I must tell the rapporteur that I cannot support paragraph 79 , which calls for the"
23346,I say to the previous speakers : the public transport in your city must be improved by
23347,we cannot use European funds for tasks that fall within the competence of the Member States .
23348,we need the funds we have for the trans-European networks .
23349,and we already have too little money .
23350,if you look at how much we have achieved in the Essen projects that we decided on together
23351,"I am also disappointed , however , by the Commission 's proposal to change the own"
23352,"of course , we are not illusionists , we too know that the Council would not make"
23353,"I do , of course , recognise that the Commission , as well as we in Parliament"
23354,no one can seriously ignore the Israeli side 's desire for peace .
23355,the last Prime Minister Barak went as far in his proposals as no other Israeli politician .
23356,the result is the current catastrophic situation .
23357,"to blame the new government under Sharon for this , as has happened here , only makes the"
23358,"if biometric risks are not taken into account , we can talk about retirement provision"
23359,"however , it is not just about the quality of pension provision in Europe ."
23360,the demand to place differently defined products and product providers on different legal bases is also
23361,"we believe that Parliament can only make itself ridiculous if , on the basis of certain sentiment"
23362,I am nevertheless pleased that you are sitting here today and that I can discuss
23363,"we owe this not least to Nicole Fontaine , because if Nicole Fontaine had not been so"
23364,this is also a truth that can be said here on this day !
23365,"finally , Mr President , I must say that the final document unfortunately contains too few"
23366,"once again , the discrepancies between the interests of the fossil fuel industry"
23367,"given the finite nature of oil resources and the Kyoto objective , we can only"
23368,I would also like to take this opportunity to briefly comment once again on the issue of the
23369,"Article 191 , as amended by the Maastricht Treaty , is mere"
23370,"I would therefore also like to propose that next year we , as Parliament , should no longer"
23371,there is a motion from the Socialist Group to make it clear that the European Union is ready
23372,"I think that this is a good proposal which should be supported , and I also think that"
23373,"as far as Biarritz is concerned , I would like to point out that it is not"
23374,it is still entirely open whether the Member States will be able to agree on a new Treat
23375,I think the French Presidency 's attitude of preferring no treaty to a bad
23376,"however , opinions on what is a good or bad treaty still differ by miles ."
23377,"moreover , the French Presidency is not spared criticism from leading European diplomats for"
23378,"however , it will depend on the behaviour of this French Presidency of the Council whether"
23379,we have reached agreement here in this room tonight .
23380,we welcome the Commission 's report and hope that it will also lead to progress in terms of
23381,"in the course of setting up an Energy Star office of the European Union , I believe it is"
23382,the Energy Star Office is to produce an annual report on the market penetration of products bearing the
23383,I consider annual sales to be appropriate because of the technical development of computer and telecom
23384,this is the only way to ensure that only those appliances are awarded the label whose
23385,"against this background , I would ask you to support my opinion , which is attached to this"
23386,the crucial question will be how to successfully integrate the Kaliningrad region into the Baltic
23387,the real problem will be the growing socio-economic gap between Poland and Lithuania on the one hand
23388,we must reduce this gap so that the growth boost that enlargement will bring cannot lead to social
23389,Commissioner Vitorino 's proposals are a first and right step in this direction .
23390,but it is not an instant program .
23391,these measures will not enter into force before 2002 .
23392,"as right as they are , we can and must do more !"
23393,"we can , for example , equip Europol better than it is currently ."
23394,Europol needs an immediate agreement with the United States of America on the exchange of data for
23395,this has failed so far because we have made our data protection regulations the standard of all
23396,"thus , with this data protection , we have benefited the terrorists more than their victim"
23397,I would also like to point out that there are 100 000 cross
23398,they have the right to refuel there !
23399,"we are creating jobs for 100,000 cross-border workers who"
23400,"so these are not sound arguments , Commissioner , and I regret that you have gone so far"
23401,this directive is the first directive under the new comitology procedure .
23402,"in my view , it is based on seven points ."
23403,"firstly , the Insider Directive , which has formed the framework so far ,"
23404,"since then , a lot has happened ."
23405,"it is based on the results of the Lisbon meeting , on the results of the Stockholm Summit ."
23406,it is part of the Financial Services Action Plan .
23407,"it is a response to 11 September , because it responds to the wish of the"
23408,"it is a response to Enron , Microsoft and the EM.TV AG trial , and in"
23409,this leads me to my second comment :
23410,it is unacceptable that the European Central Bank does not provide information on the background and argument
23411,"in fact , this Parliament is the place where the ECB must present its monetary policy decision"
23412,"if this is not done , Parliament itself cannot fulfil its mandate of monitoring the Bank'"
23413,"monetary policy is , as we know , a highly political matter and that is precisely why"
23414,the White Paper itself deserves to be called strategic because it focuses on optimising European
23415,just as many – exactly 60 – specific legislative proposals are still simmer
23416,"that is the reality of transport policy , and I consider it a scandal ."
23417,"in purely mathematical terms , we are therefore practically in 1992"
23418,"on the other hand , however , the Commission must also ask itself why it did not inform us"
23419,this is clearly a case of individual Member States violating the Social Fund Regulation .
23420,I therefore call on the Commission to find a mutually acceptable solution with the Member States
23421,"secondly , telecommunications ."
23422,Well-developed networks and fair competition generally have a positive effect on a country ’
23423,the formation of international alliances opens up new markets and thus creates a hi
23424,but transparency is also needed in this area .
23425,liberalisation is a prime example of a job creator .
23426,"they have created hundreds of thousands of new and additional jobs in Europe , among other"
23427,this is particularly problematic to me because the fact that negative decisions are not considered
23428,"less than three weeks ago , we adopted a resolution here in Strasbourg in which"
23429,"until now , we have been systematically denied such reports ."
23430,"in the meantime , Mr Brüner , the Director of the Anti-Fraud Office"
23431,he has thus also prevailed against those in the Commission who want to inform Parliament according
23432,"this has been the position of the Commission 's sometimes omnipotent Legal Service , and we"
23433,let me say a few words about the social aspects :
23434,I have observed that many farmers do not want to hand over their farms to their
23435,"I know from my own experience that letting go is difficult , but it is the only chance"
23436,I appeal to the older generation to help the younger generation and to open up the opportunities
23437,"of course , and I say this very openly as a farmer , it is not helpful"
23438,I want to make it clear that there is no profession that has only advantages or only
23439,the question you actually want to have answered is how we can prepare for the problems that will
23440,the area from which you come and the area from which I come are part of this .
23441,"as you know , I have spoken about this many , many times in your home country ,"
23442,"I believe that , in the end , there will be transitional periods for the free movement"
23443,but we are not so far here yet .
23444,we also agree that we need to promote the hotlines more so that they are really used at
23445,we also agree that we must give parents the right tools so that they can assess together with
23446,I agree with the previous speaker on this point .
23447,a European approach towards a uniform classification for the entire audiovisual sector would be of the
23448,"I am of course also pleased that the European Investment Bank , at the Commissioner 's suggestion"
23449,"I therefore believe that we have made a great deal of progress in this area , but"
23450,"I also think it is good that we are getting tax advantages at Member State level ,"
23451,so that is possible .
23452,I believe that this will also promote investment in the infrastructure of independent cinemas within the framework
23453,I believe that the expansion of cinemas in economically weaker regions within the framework of
23454,"there have been many years of negotiations , and I would like to thank the Swedish Presiden"
23455,"I think that the credibility of the Union and , in particular , of Parliament , is"
23456,I think people are tired of seeing Europe and the ministers showing hypocrisy
23457,"oil is pouring onto the beaches , and then politicians and ministers appear and try"
23458,"we will not be able to eliminate accidents 100 % , but we can make"
23459,this consistent directive is an important step in this direction .
23460,the European Parliament 's own-initiative report by Mr Salafranca comes in good time a
23461,we need a strategy and an upgrading of our Latin American policy at all levels in order
23462,the conclusion of the free trade agreement with Mexico has had a positive impact on the presence of
23463,the free trade agreement with Chile will hopefully be signed in Madrid in May .
23464,"as regards aid , several Members have called for the budget line for compensation to"
23465,"I would ask you , however , to also look at the amount of money allocated to this"
23466,"with the money available under this budget line , we cannot speak of real aid ."
23467,I remember well how we had great debates in this House in connection with BSE about what
23468,my report now provides – and this is also in line with the demands of numerous scientific
23469,"at the end of this journey , I believe that we should indeed have a largely common"
23470,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
23471,since I have just learned that some Members who are observers are voting by hand
23472,the 2000 budget includes EUR 41 billion for agricultural policy .
23473,I would like to highlight the funds allocated to the second pillar of agricultural policy
23474,the European Parliament has been very active in supporting this second pillar of agricultural policy
23475,"I will also do my utmost , within the limits of my powers , to ensure"
23476,we must also recognise what has been achieved in these ten years in the admirable
23477,"Mr Lagendijk is right , there have been enormous misdeeds in the privatisation"
23478,"there was enormous corruption , but if you look around in the associated countries , in the"
23479,the current democratic government in Croatia and the current democratic opposition in Croatia need our full support
23480,"I therefore welcome the fact that we are going to take over the guarantees today , that"
23481,but we must be clear that this is only a first small step in the right direction .
23482,"I would like to raise a second point , which concerns the European Law Academy , which"
23483,"in addition to the founding members Germany and Luxembourg , Ireland , Poland , Greece , Spain ,"
23484,Finland has indicated its intention to join .
23485,"but in thirty years ' time , we will still know what is being decided here today ."
23486,"Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am not sure what the Commission is"
23487,in the present proposal to amend the regulation establishing a support scheme for producers of certain
23488,"however , this is only to be possible for farms whose production is subject to Regulation ("
23489,"this is where our criticism comes in , and the Council largely shares this view ."
23490,I would like to emphasise this at this point .
23491,we are calling for not only organic farms to be allowed to grow legumes on set
23492,this would allow the many livestock farms to receive some compensation for the financial losses
23493,"at least , however , in addition to organic farms , account should be taken of farms"
23494,"as regards bioethics , I would urge that we follow the proposal of the Committee"
23495,this respect for sovereignty is reflected in this motion .
23496,"as I have already said , the Commission and the Member States now have a great responsibility in"
23497,"the risk of over-allocation is not completely eliminated , and the Commission must look close"
23498,"we all know that coal can be replaced very easily by gas or other energy sources , but"
23499,"this must be taken into account when the certificates are distributed , otherwise it is un"
23500,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
23501,"indeed , the agreement with Mexico is a milestone in relations with Latin American countries ."
23502,it has a wider scope than any previous agreement between the European Union and a third country .
23503,"I myself have always been very critical of this agreement with Mexico , but also shown solidarity"
23504,the agreement will therefore only be a milestone if it improves the living conditions of the
23505,how the democracy and human rights clause is implemented in practice will also be decisive .
23506,"the Fox administration will have to be measured by this , not just by economic success ."
23507,"Mr President , in the end , we are dealing with technical regulations , with technical details"
23508,"Parliament has always been very concerned about road safety in all modes of transport , especially ,"
23509,the problem for the European Union has so far been that there is no uniform control of the handling
23510,"this is how the regulation now under discussion acquires its significance , by transposing"
23511,"the most important subject of the regulation is therefore the NAFO regulations , which control non"
23512,"this is an offer to the Council , and only if we reach a satisfactory result here will"
23513,"the first signals are very positive , and I believe that this is a very important step towards"
23514,"Mr Silva , it is indeed a very important point for improving the"
23515,"of course , the benchmarking is that no more than 60 days should pass and"
23516,"of course , the goal is to have virtually no more exceptions ."
23517,the Finnish Presidency has presented its ideas to us and I would like to draw your attention
23518,"what you have explained , and what my fellow Members have mentioned in the debate"
23519,"from a purely legal point of view , the whole of Cyprus will become a member of the"
23520,"in fact , Community law cannot be applied in part of Cyprus 's territory until there"
23521,"ultimately , however , we must aim to ensure that competition only takes place where it benefits"
23522,I would therefore like to advocate – and to be a bit cautious – that
23523,I would like to mention water as an example .
23524,water is a limited resource .
23525,"we certainly cannot overnight , on a sector-specific or even case-by-case"
23526,the financial chapter of the Constitution should cover the entire budgetary process in simple terms and with clear
23527,that is why the implementation of the budget should be mentioned and the responsibility of the
23528,"budgetary discharge must be anchored , as must the obligation of the Community and"
23529,"for this purpose , the possibility of establishing a public prosecutor at Community level should"
23530,citizens expect that Community assets can be effectively protected and that fraud is prosecuted
23531,"ultimately , we also need cooperation with Yugoslavia , and we need it to"
23532,"on the one hand , we must insist that the refugees of Serbian origin who have fled"
23533,"but we also need cooperation with Yugoslavia , not only for this process but also"
23534,"even if we are now somewhat cautious and reserved , we have made it quite"
23535,"I would like to say a few words about the procedure , because this procedure is quite unusual"
23536,"the first report is a report on full codecision , whereas the Euratom report is a"
23537,but let us stick to the first report and to codecision .
23538,this is a codecision and we will be able to adopt a text after only one reading .
23539,why ?
23540,"we have had excellent cooperation with the Council , and I would like to make special mention of"
23541,he has made a great personal effort to ensure that we reached an agreement through discussion and dialogue .
23542,"however , I must also say that I have noticed a very strong willingness to engage in"
23543,"overall , there was a great deal of openness on all sides to the position"
23544,"in a sense , this is a hasty act of obedience to the vote , which I"
23545,the fact that such an agreement has been reached after first reading is only possible thanks to the willing
23546,"in theory , there is still the European Conference ."
23547,there are several ways .
23548,we have discussed in connection with the Mediterranean that there is also closer parliamentary cooperation
23549,"we must not leave this in the dark , but we must also ensure that responsibility is clar"
23550,"I believe that this intermediate phase must be defined very precisely , and the Commission should"
23551,will the European Conference be revived ?
23552,is there a specific responsibility within the Commission for this cooperation ?
23553,will it remain with Commissioner Patten ?
23554,these questions would interest me .
23555,perhaps you could explain that a little bit .
23556,the Commission has not made any proposal today on the specific budgetary estimates for the coming years
23557,this must be decided in the context of the forthcoming new financial perspective .
23558,"nevertheless , the Commission proposes a number of basic safeguards regarding the future"
23559,"the current aid is to be the minimum for the future , while future economic development is to"
23560,that is why we are of course seizing every glimmer of hope that we can support a
23561,but the situation is unthinkably bad .

23573,the Commission has not submitted a report in this regard and has not complied with the

23576,"that means that Parliament has practically been overruled , although it cannot be said that"
23577,a mean trick has been used to keep us out of the codecision procedure .
23578,"this is already the second time , as it was already the case in 1997"
23579,we have brought a complaint against this before the European Court of Justice .
23580,"this time , where codecision is a matter of course under Article 152 of the"
23581,"most likely , however , we will still be discussing whether to go to the European Court of"
23582,we will have to see if all this is sufficient .
23583,"you , Commissioner , will have to help us meet the Copenhagen criteria ."
23584,the Copenhagen criteria explicitly state that we must see developments in the political field in

23588,only then can the serious interlocutors in Bangladesh be taken seriously at international level .
23589,I ask you to continue on your course and take up Parliament 's suggestions .
23590,we will support you on this path .
23591,I would also like to emphasise that the principle of de-escalation and change through
23592,what have we achieved in Europe through this policy ?
23593,why shouldn ’ t this also be a lever for work in Asia ?
23594,I think it is good that we are working with the Asians in the ASEAN Regional Forum in
23595,"on enhanced cooperation : this will be necessary in an enlarged Community , particular"
23596,but I want to make it clear where the line is .
23597,the limit lies where the unity of the legal order and the unity of the institution are
23598,that is why we must not go too far with enhanced cooperation .
23599,it must not be an alibi for not extending majority decision-making to a sufficient
23600,I believe that there are certain rules here too that we must observe .
23601,"Madam President , Commissioner , it is late , so I shall be brief ."
23602,I am pleased with the report .
23603,I thank the Commissioner for her words .
23604,I am pleased that all my amendments were adopted in the Committee on the Environment

23606,I think it is ethically unacceptable to take primates from the wild .
23607,"if you believe that you cannot do without them , you have to breed them ."
23608,"Madam President , I have a question for the President-in-Office of the Council ."
23609,there are reports in the press today that the Israeli Prime Minister did not receive the European Union
23610,Mr Sharon has not seen Mr Solana .
23611,can the Council give us more information ?
23612,"is it because there was no time , because Prime Minister Sharon has travelled to Moscow , or"
23613,is the Council aware of this ?
23614,I 'd like to know .
23615,"Mr President , I would like to say to Mr Liepitz that I still hold the view"
23616,"however , I am not sure whether last week ’ s rate cut fits exactly into this"
23617,I would like to express my personal doubts .
23618,"in order for this cooperation to be fully effective and to achieve its objectives , it"
23619,the Commission is confident that the Nicaraguan authorities will take account of these concerns raised

23639,"every time a fisherman has his vessel scrapped with public funds , this ceiling is reduced"
23640,"to do this , we also need a system that defines the ratio in which new ships"
23641,"Mr President , Mrs Groeneveld , I would like to remind you that I"
23642,"the proposals I intend to make will , of course , take into account , as far"
23643,but what will not be the case is that there can be any instructions to the Commission .

23646,"in my country , this is a major debate , and here too it is the Christian Democratic Group"
23647,the European Food Authority must act independently of the Commission in order to be able to intervene

23655,aid for the use of transport infrastructure should reflect the various burdens that the choice of means
23656,this means that infrastructure and external costs must be included in the aid calculation .
23657,equality of competition between modes of transport is achieved by making the difference between the costs
23658,unfortunately – and this has already been mentioned – there is no politically legitimate
23659,"that is why , after a long and careful deliberation , I have agreed to the"

23666,"indeed , I think that the legislative work in this House is not reflected in the"
23667,the PPE Group has had a very difficult time with this Commission proposal .
23668,"this is also linked to the fact that there are , of course , very different legal tradition"
23669,"we have therefore put a great deal of effort into reaching a compromise , including"
23670,there was not a single vote against within the group .
23671,we therefore need a better climate .
23672,"we need simpler laws and , above all , we must not make the mistake – even"
23673,we know much better today than we did ten years ago that vitamins do have negative consequences
23674,I think it is actually irresponsible to let them go to consumers in this way .
23675,"Mrs. Mc Kenna , I am actually deeply disappointed ."
23676,"I thought you were recommending oranges , lemons , bananas , kale and whatever"
23677,"no , you are recommending artificial means , means that are simply made by industry , where many"
23678,I don 't understand you !
23679,the Commission will follow up on the main results of your work .

23692,new powers should enable the Assembly to exercise increased financial control over the expenditure of

23694,I believe that the Prodi plan can bring a new quality to cooperation with Russia and it
23695,let us remember that there was also a basis in the European Union when the coal and steel plan

23697,"in the same way , the energy community with Russia can also acquire a political dimension ."
23698,"this means that we have a joint responsibility for peace in the Caucasus , for environmental protection"
23699,"as regards the other institutions , just a few remarks ."
23700,I think that we should already try to work closely with the Economic and Social Committee and the

23702,we will have to follow the Court very closely .

23713,we have the case in the EU where institutions are located in different places or can be relo

23718,I generally think that the establishment of a European satellite navigation programme is sensible and worthy
23719,"nevertheless , I voted against the Glante report today , as I cannot agree with"
23720,an agreement could be reached that EUR 300 million should be budgeted for the year
23721,"Mr President , Mr President-designate Prodi , we Socialists are disappointed ."
23722,"despite announcements , you have not managed to achieve a better balance between men and women"

23743,that is why we must also provide the European Court of Justice with the appropriate resources .

23790,you were quite able to propose legal bases very quickly for other things .
23791,you practice modesty in the border regions .
23792,"however , it is not enough for you to say here that you are watching with great interest"
23793,the Commission is called upon to present an initiative on this .
23794,"that is your honorable task , and you cannot steal from your responsibility in this respect"

24254,hope also comes from our partnership agreements with the human rights clauses .
24255,agreements are suspended when human rights are systematically and massively violated .
24256,this creates productive pressure .
24257,"on the occasion of the current affairs , we all know that each Member State has its own"

24261,"I am in favour of a frugal budget , including in the agricultural sector ,"

24265,this perspective must now be realized .

24340,I hope not .

24342,"for me , as an elected representative from a medium-sized country , the question"
24343,"unfortunately , in recent weeks there has been a very concrete occasion for these questions , and"
24344,if we consider that there is about 7 billion available for venture capital in Europe and

24346,the very word BSE would be a stimulus here to think about what new businesses we can

24348,"Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen ."
24349,I would like to express my sincere thanks for the initiative taken by the Commission in this

24355,any weakening of our European fish processing industry means the loss of a large number of jobs

24364,"today , they are rightly called the key sector of the European economy ."
24365,two thirds of all jobs in Europe are already in the services sector .
24366,it is above all the dynamism and the innovative power that make this sector so important for

24368,I have had a very close and trusting relationship with the President of the Czech Parliament for many

24370,the President of the Czech Parliament did not mention the case that you took as the basis for your

24372,it is well known that President Klaus sometimes expresses views that are different from those shared by the

24379,we must therefore do everything possible to ensure that Malaysia returns to the spirit of Abdul Rahman
24380,I believe that the time of Mr Mahathir is over and that new democratic forces must take over
24381,it is simply wrong to say that from the point of view of a student the level of support

24388,"on paper , I think , we have been developing this issue for years , and we have"
24389,"nevertheless , we are all always frightened by the often untenable situations"

24394,"I think we will all pay close attention to what happens during the French Presidency , to"
24395,"finally , we must also deal with the Ombudsman 's budget ."
24396,we were able to be relatively restrained here because the Council has already taken all the
24397,I think that the Council initially tried to wait for a risk assessment in order to keep
24398,"that was completely unacceptable , and we are therefore also pleased that the Council has"
24399,"not only does common sense say that no one wants carcinogens in face creams ,"
24400,"I can say that the Secretary-General of Parliament has provided all the information requested , as"
24401,"that is why I am in favour of granting discharge , as I was in April"
24402,the Committee on Budgetary Control has endorsed this by a large majority .
24403,many people ask whether we need a European party statute .
24404,the European Parliament is the only institution of the European Union legitimised by direct free elections .
24405,the European Parliament is also considered the cradle of European political parties .
24406,cooperation in the groups required closer contacts with each other and with the home parties .
24407,this led to the gradual development of new international party structures and European parties .
24408,I would just like to point out that the European People 's Party has existed since
24409,I think that is not the case !
24410,"however , we must concentrate on these important things in the requirements that the Commission has set for"

24414,this is particularly true of his comments on aid policy .
24415,it is true that renewable energies need aid to boost their development now and probably
24416,that is also completely correct and in accordance with the Treaty .

24421,we must not put everything in one basket .
24422,"the last point , which I too consider to be a prerequisite for liberalisation to"
24423,I have already mentioned it :
24424,"one of the reasons for the roads ' prevalence , among many other things , is"
24425,parliamentarisation of the EU means strengthening all the representatives of the people vis-à
24426,the debate on the respective roles obviously requires intellectual and political clarity .
24427,some people here have mixed these things up a little .
24428,we must distinguish between the levels at which national parliaments have a role to play and the
24429,what did Gregori Pasko do ?
24430,he did nothing more than his duty as a journalist and as a citizen .
24431,he photographed an illegal dump of nuclear waste and he has shown civil courage .
24432,"for this reason , he was sentenced in Russia to several years of forced labour ."
24433,I think it is a scandal that Europe is simply watching this happen .
24434,I would also like to congratulate ourselves on having had the courage in

24461,"as far as Kosovo is concerned , I can only say - I was there again just last"
24462,there are many common problems .
24463,"there are ethnic tensions in some countries , there is insufficient refugee return ,"
24464,one thing is clear : there must be no retreat from our commitment .
24465,this is the lakmus test for our credibility !
24466,"as Joost said , we need to have an exact idea of what we will do in the"
24467,I consider the independent role of the European Ombudsman to be very important as an example for
24468,"like the majority of this House and my group , I am sure , I share the view that"
24469,"by adopting this directive , we are taking a good and sensible step in this direction ."
24470,"the authorities of the Member States have a huge amount of information , which has been collect"
24471,citizens and entrepreneurs should benefit from this wealth of information .
24472,"let me also say that , from an economic point of view , it is extremely important that"
24473,"we have no use for auctions , as the bitter experiences of the past have show"
24474,"this is important from the point of view of investment , because we do not end up with a"

24481,"I hope that work on a common recruitment office , as it is called in modern German"
24482,I really want to see great progress in this area .
24483,I would like to conclude by referring to something that Jacques Delors said .
24484,"Jacques Delors once quite rightly remarked , in the endless debates we had on"
24485,so there is very little emotion involved .
24486,"I would say the same for a currency , although there are some of us who have"
24487,"but what we need and what we must reveal is the awareness of the common European identity ,"
24488,I believe that this is certainly the most important task facing us as the European Parliament .
24489,the Commission 's Green Paper and Mr Sacconi 's report also pay particular attention to
24490,the industry is already voluntarily renouncing cadmium in PVC products .
24491,the use of lead is also increasingly being reduced .
24492,"in certain product groups , such as window frames , this stabilizer is already being replaced"
24493,one problem that naturally arises for small and medium-sized companies is how to provide
24494,"because , especially now , due to the Basel II regulations , which are about creditworthi"
24495,"it is important that national , regional or local political decision-makers think about how to help small"

24500,next time it will be a president speaking here and then being hindered or attacked
24501,I would like to know what this means for the reputation of the European Parliament .
24502,"Mr President , I was still confused by Mr Knolle , but I will not tell you"
24503,those who were in the Chamber just now know what I mean .
24504,"I am taking up this interesting report by Mr Belder , and I do not need to quote"
24505,"money is there but not spent , and we say quite soberly : inefficient"
24506,"we believe that this is part of the alignment at this stage , but the Commission is"
24507,"I think that , in this respect , we must try to enter into discussions with the Commission"
24508,"I would like to thank the rapporteurs , in particular Carlos Costa Neves and , of course"
24509,we have made some progress in terms of truth and clarity in Parliament 's budget .
24510,it makes little sense to put money in the reserve for a statute that is then spent
24511,"it is therefore more appropriate to put it directly in the budget line for buildings ,"
24512,"however , we will have to ensure – and this is a lesson learned from this year"
24513,"we cannot accept the procedure as it has been this year , namely that many important decisions"
24514,we therefore ask you to ensure that what you have once again stated today as necessary
24515,"we know that there are some groups in Iran , for example , who do not want to follow"
24516,but we also know that there are strong forces in Iran to take this path in a positive sense
24517,"when we talk about people being hungry , we must see that 80 % of the"
24518,how can the hungry export food to Europe if they themselves have nothing to eat ?
24519,"we must ask : who is trading with Europe , with what products and under what conditions ?"
24520,"if we trade and import food raw materials , which are then processed here and brought back with"
24521,Europe is the largest import area for food .
24522,"if we ask how we can change the trade balance in favour of the third world countries ,"

24534,"in the meantime , the rapporteur has had contact with all the associations active in this"

24537,"the Council and , as I said , the Commission also responded to this ."
24538,"fourthly , on the late payment directive , I note Parliament 's repeated point"

24551,I would like to emphasise once again the importance of the detailed consultations in the
24552,these experts also emphasised the importance of taking steps towards investment and of relying on demand
24553,"I do not think that what you , Mr von Wogau , have described here as the"
24554,this includes both supply and demand-oriented measures .
24555,"we also see this in other countries of the world , which are more successful than your home country"
24556,the Commission will present its proposal for the employment guidelines to us this afternoon .
24557,"for the first time , we will then have employment guidelines for three years ."
24558,this will finally give us the opportunity to make the European Social Fund – our only labour market policy
24559,"now , for the first time , we have the opportunity to link the employment strategy and the"
24560,"after this report , we must say clearly what we actually expect from a European cultural policy ,"
24561,"when you talk to people working in the cultural sector today , they are all afraid that ,"
24562,"I hope not , and we will fight for it ."
24563,"Mr President , I will speak in telegram style because of the time constraints ."
24564,"firstly , I would like to thank you , Mrs Thyssen , for your excellent report ."
24565,"secondly , I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs"
24566,"we must also consider the environmental impact , if we are in favour of an internal market ."
24567,is it really environmentally sensible for us to favour heavy-duty transport with this directiv
24568,isn 't diesel passenger cars urgently needed to reduce CO2 emissions ?
24569,we therefore see no justification for aligning the mineral oil tax rates on diesel and
24570,does this wild growth in different diesel tax rates not also lead to abuse and to
24571,"firstly , while the divergence between Member States has decreased , the differences"
24572,Mr Pronk pointed out in his speech that the problem is not so much in the strategy
24573,I would like to express my full support for this and assure you that we will do everything we

24575,it is very difficult to speed things up in the Commission because there is no international institution that has
24576,"so if we want things to go faster , we should also help to simplify procedures"
24577,"let me say at this point , in response to Mrs Paciotti 's point , that"
24578,"if there are , as you say , bureaucratic obstacles , I promise you that I"
24579,"there is , for example , a recent debate on the definition of soya as a protein"
24580,"this , of course , also has an international dimension , but I am in favour of us"
24581,on the comprehensive report by Mr Dell 'Alba - it deals with the issue of
24582,"I will have to limit myself to a few comments on this , too ."
24583,the Structural Funds Regulation of June 1999 now contains new provisions
24584,the European Central Bank is independent .
24585,it is primarily committed to price stability .
24586,I would like to remind Mrs Randzio-Plath that the Treaty states quite clear
24587,"it is about innovation not only in the economic sphere , but also in the social , cultural"
24588,we would like to see publicly funded research adjusted so that in future we can make
24589,"where will there be services or products in the future that the citizen would like , that"
24590,"this market research is very important for us in the future , so that we can see where we"
24591,"we call on the Commission to examine the technical conditions and to consult the scientific community on this ,"
24592,"it is not acceptable that the industry may be making money , which is its right , but"
24593,this must be clarified .
24594,we can see from the reactions to this legislation that in some regions that want to declar
24595,the basic political situation in Malta has not changed .
24596,Malta continues to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria .
24597,its institutions are democratic and function smoothly .
24598,there are no particular problems with regard to human rights .
24599,"the overall situation of economic , social and cultural rights is satisfactory ."
24600,"in the economic field , Malta has a functioning market economy and is capable of competing with"
24601,"in addition , there is very often the possibility that funding opportunities , which are sufficient"

24604,"the European Year of Lifelong Learning was a good stimulus , which must be continued and consolida"
24605,"I also wonder why the Commission , contrary to its usual practice , does not define precis"
24606,the debate on the money-laundering directive in particular has shown us how necessary
24607,the definition of European funding must not be left to the discretion of the Member States .
24608,I therefore proposed adopting the old definition from the GROTIUS Civil Law programme .
24609,I would have liked to see us responding to the multiannual needs with proper multi
24610,"this means , of course , that we will face the same mountain of difficulties in the next"
24611,"Mr President , Commissioner , it is good that we have witnesses here today who are listening"
24612,all these citizens who are listening to us here today are taxpayers and are the
24613,"and , Commissioner , the people in the third row of your Commission , your officials , in particular"
24614,"Mr President , as rapporteur , I would like to make two or three very brief comments ."
24615,"first , a general one ."
24616,"I believe that it would be useful if , in future discharge procedures in this Parliament ,"
24617,"secondly , in my original report , which was adopted in committee in March and voted"
24618,"in committee , my group and the Greens voted in favour of resolving this problem"
24619,it concerns the issue of the payment of party employees from the group 's funds .
24620,this proposal by me was removed from my draft report at the time by a majority vote
24621,"Mr Poettering may not know this yet , but I am hereby giving him this information"
24622,we must condemn in the strongest possible terms these methods of pursuing political objectives
24623,"in a democracy , no one can bomb and murder themselves in negotiations ."
24624,violence and terror must not be rewarded or be worth it .
24625,"of course , building on what the political leaders have done since Macedonia gained independence , not"
24626,"the Albanian minority certainly has a special position in this regard because of its size , but"
24627,"there is certainly a need for greater recognition of the Albanian language and a gradual ,"
24628,the European Union must intervene here with its means of prevention and civil crisis management and help
24629,"on labelling , I am very pleased that the consumer-friendly system of labelling genetic"
24630,you will remember that last year around this time we had a very controversial and also very

24632,I should like to add that I had planned to give an explanation of vote on
24633,"of course , that was not necessary ."
24634,"when I then hear that , for example , Italy has not yet met the technical requirements for this"
24635,I would be pleased if the Commissioner could make a few comments on this .
24636,"unlike Mr Karas , I believe that the Stability and Growth Pact is right"
24637,I believe that it is in a serious crisis because it is too inflexible with its arbitra
24638,"in times of stagnation and recession , its shackles prove to be poison"
24639,it is no coincidence that the euro area finance ministers have already called on the Commission to
24640,I therefore strongly advocate reforming the Stability Pact and supplementing it with
24641,I am pleased to present this report on the 10th anniversary of German un

24643,but I think that we must now also make it clear that we are now on the verge of
24644,what we have called the European Union so far covers only a small part of this continent .
24645,"we have the opportunity to create a new order in which no one loses his identity , in"
24646,"we will also be able to create an order in which war between us becomes impossible , in"
24647,I hope that we have the inner strength to forget the little things and realize the big
24648,I would ask them to support this report .
24649,"in this debate in our group , questions were also raised and doubts expressed , and"
24650,"we cannot keep this secret , and that is why we respect the attitude of those who decide"
24651,the vast majority of our group will vote in favour of the Commission of Mr Prodi .
24652,but this is neither a blank check nor a carte blanche !
24653,"we will take you on your word , Mr Prodi , that is to say , we will"
24654,"my final question , because I am repeatedly asked about it , is to the Commission :"
24655,will the directive prejudge the accession negotiations ?
24656,"how do you see the interpretation of Article 1 , because it plays an important role for"
24657,what is the reality in Europe ?
24658,"we have recessionary to deflationary phenomena , characterised by the Commission 's"
24659,"this will result in pension and social systems being reduced , and it will not promote the willing"
24660,that is the problem .
24661,"thirdly , the Convention did not stop at the copying off of old rights – even the"
24662,"secondly , let me say something in the interest of the dogs ."
24663,"I also have a dog , and he has told me that he does not want to be electronic"
24664,it is not so fun for dogs to be dragged around .
24665,when you see how these poor dogs are put in these awful cages while barking
24666,research and science without conscience would be the ruin of humanity .
24667,"therefore , it must be a matter of sending very clear signals here ."
24668,it is also important that this report emphasises once again that cloning of human beings
24669,"I think it cannot be stressed often enough , both in Parliament and outside , that we need"
24670,"much has been said about donations without payment , and it is clear that the fact that the"
24671,"thirdly , there are - and I am therefore grateful to Mr Bösch for"
24672,"there are obviously problems of measurement , statistical problems , which we have to solve so"
24673,"Mr President , I believe that the report by Mr Duhamel which is being debated today"
24674,"finally , the crucial question is how the European unification process should be further shaped ."
24675,it is about the future of the European Union .
24676,"as we know , there are very different views on this in the various Member States , among the"
24677,"in my group too , there are differing opinions on this ."
24678,I believe that this diversity of opinions is essential and I see it as an enrich
24679,"in the agreement with Guinea , too , I understand you welcome the technical elements we have introduced"
24680,you must know that today 's decision also means that the budget has reached its end and that
24681,nothing is possible anymore .
24682,"anything that happens now in the future will have dramatic consequences , not only for us"
24683,"you can assume that you will once again have our approval , but that it will be much"
24684,I have therefore tried to make it clear in my report that the usefulness of our water
24685,"in doing so , the comprehensive supply and disposal , high environmental standards , the"
24686,the first thing that will probably be discussed there is the general growth rates for the
24687,the Commission 's proposal - I would like to repeat it once again - provides for a

24690,"if we had reached a conclusion on this issue on the basis of the European Patent Convention , you"
24691,I believe that the amendments will help to achieve this .
24692,last but not least :
24693,the European Patent Office and so-called unfair patents which may have been granted
24694,"it is commendable that Europe is showing responsibility in this area , but the first"
24695,"in the European Union , all Member States are basically equal ."
24696,this European Union can only exist if the competences are in the hands of supranational institutions and
24697,"if this principle is not accepted , we will be in great trouble ."
24698,"amendments Nos 7 , 8 , 16 to 19 concern the"
24699,this should apply in particular to environmental measures .
24700,"I must draw your attention to the fact that such a regulation already exists , in the form"
24701,1982 .
24702,"the establishment of producer groups has , by the way , been funded by the Community"
24703,"as is the case in other sectors , they must rely on the funds provided for in"
24704,the second is that the European Council should confirm the election of the President of the Commission by the
24705,so what now ?
24706,by majority or unanimity ?
24707,what are you proposing ?
24708,"and if the Council does not confirm , what then ?"
24709,does Parliament have the right to dissolve the Council ?
24710,that is what I would suggest .
24711,there is no conflict resolution mechanism in your proposals .
24712,finally - and this is the bottom line - the Commission 's double responsibility to Parliament
24713,"yes , what is happening ?"
24714,you step back every time ?
24715,"if Parliament says you have our confidence , do you stay , and if the Council says you"
24716,so what clarity does this bring to the institutional construction of the European Union ?
24717,it creates confusion !
24718,"your proposal on this point , Mr Barroso , creates more problems than it solves ,"
24719,"Mr Patten was right to mention Kyoto , in other words climate policy ."
24720,"if I had time , I could calculate what emissions trading could mean for Latin America in"
24721,the President signals to me that I do not have that time .
24722,"if I had them , I would calculate it for you , and you would be surprised"
24723,"in short , we have many opportunities to engage with Latin America ."
24724,we must use them and not just talk about them !
24725,this includes consolidating the rule of law and strengthening state institutions .
24726,this also includes the development of a civil society as an important prerequisite for the consolida
24727,"in the economic field , the Union is seeking to integrate Russia into a common economic and"
24728,"the Union is already Russia 's most important transformation , investment and trade partner , accounting"

24732,"in fact , if practical problems arise due to the migration of stocks between the"
24733,"however , such potential problems cannot be solved by taking pelagic species out of the regulation"
24734,"secondly , the fears that the financing conditions for SMEs will deteriorate"
24735,"the one million euro threshold must be raised , otherwise the cost of loans"
24736,it is completely incomprehensible that no detailed analysis has been presented at European level
24737,"therefore , the rapporteur 's request that this study on SMEs be presented"
24738,I therefore ask all Members of good will to debate this today so that we can vote
24739,I am therefore very strongly against this motion .
24740,I also regret having to say this to my colleague and friend Mr Dupuis .
24741,"in all friendship , Mr Dupuis , I would ask you to perhaps change your mind ."
24742,"Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to congratulate"
24743,"despite some differences in detail , it is the case that we will - at least I"
24744,"indeed , this package , building on previous decisions , is a major step towards the establi"
24745,"the national restrictions and fears that still exist will , I hope , soon be a thing"
24746,"we have based our proposal on the financial framework agreed in Berlin , and I regret that"
24747,just think of the nomadic populations in the desert .
24748,"to do this , special forms of education and training have to be found , to name just"
24749,"this is an enormous educational challenge , which is very well supported by many donor"
24750,"radio can also be an important aid , especially for sparsely populated regions ."

24771,"Mr President , the Council , the Commission and Parliament are fully aware of the situation in Zimbabwe ."
24772,no one can claim that he knew nothing .
24773,"the Council of Ministers , which is now remaining passive , is becoming an accompli"
24774,it is a scandal that there was no decision yet at yesterday 's meeting of the Council
24775,it seems that the Presidency is only talking about the priority it is promoting for Africa
24776,"unfortunately , France is leading a group of member states that seem to have a different agenda"

24778,policymakers must develop a system that will help the principle of the cost truth of the mo
24779,this resolution is an important step and a call on the Commission to finally put concrete proposals on
24780,we are talking about the Hungarians who had already risen in 1956 .
24781,"in a speech in Hungary last week , I pointed out that I believe all European politicians"
24782,it took 50 years to give the right answer .
24783,"we simply have to say that no one , not even the Commission , wants to change the"
24784,that is nonsense !
24785,it is primarily about the weekend trips .
24786,that is the question !
24787,"a forwarder , an employee must know when he can drive through where , when he must stop"
24788,"of course , you also need to have proper parking spaces with sanitary facilities ."
24789,"on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy"
24790,the time is ripe .
24791,the EU is set to enlarge by ten new Member States next year .
24792,"the Community budget will continue to grow , and the management of European funds will become even more complex"
24793,"at the same time , cross-border crime will increase , becoming more and more professional thanks"
24794,the territorial fragmentation of criminal justice systems and the difficulties in judicial cooperation between Member States
24795,statistics show that up to € 1 billion in damage is caused to the EU budget
24796,this money may be used to finance other criminal structures .
24797,the best example is cigarette smuggling .
24798,European taxpayers ' money is lost for the EU 's real objectives .
24799,"I repeat : lost , because we do not yet have efficient structures in Europe"
24800,"I would therefore like to highlight the increased inclusion of vocational training measures ,"
24801,"line B should also be open to employment policy support , especially in the context of the pre"
24802,Articles 41 and 94 of the EC Treaty not only give us a clear
24803,it is up to us to give this issue the appropriate political priority .
24804,"there is hardly any policy area for which the EU , the Member States , regional and local"
24805,subsidiarity therefore applies to a very special extent here .
24806,a second issue that many have raised is the question of the use of Community funds to help
24807,in my introductory remarks I pointed out that we have adopted a whole series
24808,I also pointed out that we have so far approved eight national aid measures
24809,"but as far as direct Community aid for Belgian producers is concerned , I must"
24810,"for , ladies and gentlemen , I agree with those who have stated here that the"
24811,we can only pay compensation or aid if it is an animal disease .
24812,"as regards the growth policy , which you also address in detail in your programme , we support"
24813,we must decide quickly .
24814,this Parliament must make decisions quickly in order to implement this growth programme .
24815,"with all the emphasis on investments , we also need to invest in knowledge and network"
24816,we have seen in recent months that if we only liberalise but do not at the same time
24817,"if we want to modernise Europe , we – the European Union as a whole , but of"
24818,"we cannot keep industry out of this sector , because if industry adheres to standards , its"

24828,these are the main points on which I wanted to comment today .

24831,"Mr President , Commissioner , Seattle did not fail simply because the agenda was perhaps too demanding"
24832,"Seattle also failed because it became clear that the WTO , as it is organised ,"
24833,perhaps we should also reflect on the objectives of the WTO .
24834,many groups say that the WTO is hindering us in developing social and environmental standards
24835,we have always called for – and now there is time for that – an analysis at last to
24836,the next indent reads : ‘ Amendment of the Bathing Water Directive ’
24837,what does that mean : change ?
24838,does that mean setting the standards high ?
24839,"does this mean the same standards as in the drinking water directive , or does"
24840,"so , we need more clarity here ."
24841,I now turn to the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and
24842,"we must do so , too , but we must do so at second reading , because then we"
24843,I would urge you to give us a negotiating mandate at first reading and to

24845,we will certainly return to this topic more often .
24846,I very much hope – and I am not saying this without reason – that the next time this
24847,a lot of technical issues were addressed .
24848,I find it absolutely incomprehensible why this Commission does not publicly advocate that

24863,I am keen to see the content of the ILO Conference of 1998 become

25375,that must be the aim of this directive .

25377,and he is rightly in court .
25378,"not because he smuggled , but because he whistled the smuggled East German"
25379,I believe that it should also be possible today for people who turn refugees or smugglers
25380,why ?
25381,both the Commission proposal and the report acknowledge that illegal entry can lead to an asylum
25382,this is an admission – albeit probably very involuntary – that it is no longer possible
25383,that is why the promised impunity for refugees who are accepted as asylum seekers

25385,"if we cannot decide to dismantle the EU Fortress , we must at least reject"
25386,it is also a matter of making it clear once again that in the 2004

25395,the slaughter premium is regulated in the market regulation and is the same for all animals .
25396,I cannot therefore give you any further answer – at least not to what has been translated as

25440,the committees responsible for agriculture and the environment have not yet been able to deal
25441,I want to have a serious debate on this .
25442,"I therefore ask you , Madam President , not to debate this tomorrow , but to do"
25443,one of the most important improvements – as the rapporteur has already mentioned – is the
25444,the increase in funding from EUR 50.4 million to EUR 93 million
25445,but that leads to a more general and political discussion which obviously goes beyond the scope

25447,"in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , the proposals put forward"
25448,"finally , Mr President-in-Office , I would like to ask you to ensure that"
25449,the candidate countries have a legitimate interest in knowing what is being discussed at the Inter
25450,I therefore believe that we should take account of this legitimate interest of the accession countries
25451,"in this sense , Mr President-in-Office , I wish you every success in your work"
25452,it has already been said that we wanted more money because we believe that education and training are of

25454,the Council wants to have its common negotiating position on the budgetary chapter set by
25455,the budgetary chapter is the crowning achievement of the accession negotiations .
25456,the Commission has already decided that it will submit a proposal which does not go beyond the amounts
25457,this was also laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement .
25458,"in this respect , the Commission counts on the support of the budgetary authority to ensure that"
25459,"Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen ."
25460,"on 28 August 1998 , the Commission submitted a proposal for a"

25467,"a compromise must certainly be found here , so that although we call for the re"

25469,recital 0 of the report is an important signal in this regard and we fully support it
25470,"although paragraphs 46 and 47 are in principle welcome , the report lacks"
25471,we were able to support all the amendments and points which support the decommissioning
25472,as much as the report lacks more binding words on issues such as Beneš and Teme

25477,it did not consist of examining the policy on oilseed cultivation in the Community as a

25479,we must therefore distinguish the current additional protein deficit from the situation that we have always had
25480,it is a fact that we import about 30 million tonnes of soy and soy equivalent
25481,closing this gap is probably not possible at all - at least with the current options available to
25482,we must not forget one thing : soya beans cannot be grown everywhere in
25483,we cannot compensate for this fact by means of a policy of subsidies .
25484,"I do not quite understand , Mr Böge , what you mean by incorrect calculation"
25485,"in Copenhagen , negotiations were conducted and no calculations were made ."
25486,"for internal policies , as for the other areas , the figures have been set , how"
25487,I should also like to point out once again that there will be new programmes in the internal

25499,"we parliamentarians , the representatives elected by the people , have acted in accord"

25503,"Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr van Dam ."
25504,I think he has produced a very good report .
25505,"if you look at the explanatory statement again , you will see that it contains a whole"
25506,"on Europe 's roads , what is either criminal or filthy or both happens ,"
25507,Mr van Dam has also explained in great detail in his report that this dossier does not

25529,"we had hoped for more democratisation , so that we could offer citizens more transparency"
25530,"we need more transparency in this area , and the citizens are entitled to it ."
25531,"in this sense , we are imposing on Turkey the same conditions as we have imposed on"
25532,Turkey has neither a disadvantage nor a privilege .
25533,that is also the purpose of my report and of those paragraphs – which now seem to be
25534,it makes little sense to talk about equal treatment of Turkey and demanding equal obligations
25535,it will certainly be a very difficult path in Turkey and for Turkey to meet the criteria
25536,I believe that it is a decisive step forward that we have a system of competences which
25537,this is also important so that the Member States do not feel that they are losing their identity
25538,"if the order of competences is clear , then we can also demand improved decision-making"

25546,we have examined what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf meant by the early marketing premium
25547,the fact is that we had such a premium in 1996 and in the years
25548,we have calculated that this premium alone has cost EUR 200 00
25549,"the effect that has resulted is therefore rather questionable , because in any case 4"

25560,may I return to the budgetary procedure for the financial year 2000 .
25561,"last year 's budgetary procedure , if I may put it diplomaticly , was extreme"
25562,I have had a good opportunity to get to know you very well and have seen that the Committee

25567,I have the impression that our American friends also view their relations with Europe more as bilateral ones
25568,President Bush gave a remarkable speech in the German Bundestag in Berlin .
25569,"you can emphasise almost everything , but the term European Union does not appear in this speech"
25570,this shows how important it is that we intensify our dialogue with the American government !
25571,we should decide as the European Parliament that informal trialogues are only allowed if the minister
25572,"we are not sending our advisors to an informal conciliation procedure , but"
25573,there can be no question of the promised “ appropriate balance between political complexity ” .
25574,the Commission is mostly left-wing .
25575,Romano Prodi did not oppose the current German Chancellor when he proposed a Green and
25576,Schröder ’ s lack of concept and pure power orientation have spread the word ;
25577,the Germans are currently giving him juicy receipts from state to state .
25578,"unlike his predecessor Helmut Kohl , who accepted the opposition ’ s proposal for"
25579,Elmar Brok would have been a brilliant proposal that would have won the majority .
25580,I would like to thank Mr Färm for his report on the 2003 budget

25583,this can then be taken into account in the autumn .
25584,I have made one of these projects available to the members of the Committee on Transport .
25585,there are some better or equally good .
25586,"we must choose the best , because even this small project will be the test of transport policy and"

25624,five months are provided .
25625,that seems a little too long to me .
25626,you should try to get shorter times here .

25630,the citizens are not aware of the Member States ' shared responsibility for all European decisions because
25631,let me ask you in conclusion :
25632,are the regional parliaments fulfilling their role of parliamentary control over their representatives in the
25633,no !
25634,do the national parliaments exercise their parliamentary control over the Council 's activities ?
25635,does the European Parliament fulfil its tasks of parliamentary control over the Commission and its

25637,"if we do not fully fulfil our role as parliamentarians at regional , national and European"

25651,I therefore believe that we should follow the example of establishing closer dialogue between the two

25653,there is an urgent need for action !

25670,I would like to begin by briefly explaining why we are dealing with defence issues
25671,"in 1999 , the Heads of Government decided to set up a European crisis"
25672,"this crisis intervention force , which was actually a virtual crisis intervention force , not a stand"
25673,"in conclusion , I would like to say what I expect from this reform : fair competition and"
25674,"I am looking forward to seeing how the discussions , which are being conducted on a"
25675,"firstly , we are still dealing with democracy , social justice and ecology in Europe ."
25676,even if we succeed in achieving the breakthroughs we need in the area of
25677,that is what this report deals with .
25678,"despite this reality , which we have applauded in recent days and rejoiced at"
25679,"to date , we have no regulation on the legal status and financing of European political parties ."
25680,we do not have a uniform voting right .
25681,we have no possibility of assigning mandates on European lists .
25682,the European Parliament 's decision on a Members ' Statute last week in Strasbourg
25683,"with the decision on the legal status of European parties , which I hope will be adopted tomo"
25684,the Commission raised the issue of humanitarian aid both in the political dialogue and at the
25685,the discussion on this issue has not yet led to a satisfactory outcome .
25686,"I would like to state , however , that the Commission still has a primary interest in being present"
25687,"after all , we are the largest donor of humanitarian aid in this conflict ."
25688,"Furthermore , it is the first budget we have to deal with under the regime of"
25689,we will have more problems in the coming years if everything that was decided in Helsinki - I am
25690,I therefore expect - and this has already been mentioned by previous speakers this evening -
25691,"I think that each government can decide on this in its own Member State , and we can also"
25692,"at the same time , the Member States ' budgets will no longer be able to bear additional"
25693,the citizens of the Union will not accept higher burdens .
25694,"if we decide to do so , the political landscape of the Union will likely change in the future"
25695,the citizens will certainly give us the answer in the next elections .
25696,"comparisons of quality - whether internal or external - create competition , and if this improves the"
25697,let us therefore help to ensure that the report on implementation that the Commission is to submit
25698,I would like to draw attention to two things briefly .
25699,"Mr Hudghton asked whether it would be possible to include designations of origin , such"
25700,"voluntary designations of origin of this kind are possible , provided that they are not protected"
25701,one third of your candidates did not answer the question from the Committee on Women 's Rights
25702,the Social Democrats have always demanded and continue to demand – and I emphasise this
25703,we are calling for the College and for you as the head of the Commission to develop ambition
25704,"Mrs Diamantopoulou , whose portfolio includes employment and the social dimension , as"
25705,I emphasise this firstly because it is an expression of budgetary discipline at European level
25706,"this , too , should be emphasised ."
25707,as was explained to the budgetary authorities in the trialogue on 2 July
25708,at that trialogue meeting it was agreed that the Commission would submit a proposal in September
25709,the funds are to be raised largely through reallocations and by using as little additional
25710,it was also agreed that the two arms of the budgetary authority would deal with
25711,"we count on Parliament 's support in this regard , so that the European Community can continue to"
25712,"Mr President , unlike the Commission discharge in April , we did not just postpone Parliament"
25713,"this report therefore only had to deal with paragraph 33 of the April resolution ,"
25714,"I would also like to make it very clear that , in the interests of a serious dis"
25715,Christmas is only in half a year .
25716,we should therefore focus only on the things that have actually been demanded .
25717,both texts - the text of 13 April and this one - must be read together
25718,I would like to remind you that the level of humanitarian aid in Sierra Leone does
25719,"in the care sector , employment growth is 5.5 % ."
25720,the health and social sector is therefore a job creator .
25721,it is not possible to hire all people because many areas of mobile care and care services are not
25722,"in this context , I therefore call for the following : the upgrading and expansion of"
25723,we need to strengthen the resources in the personal environment and expand the support and support of relative

25725,we need an image campaign for care professions and an investigation into the causes of the high
25726,we need European standards because care is one of the greatest challenges of our time .
25727,this is also the position taken by the Commission in negotiations with developing countries on poverty
25728,it is very important for the Commission to play an active role in these negotiations and to
25729,the very ambitious objective is to make the European Union the most dynamic knowledge-
25730,"in 1997 , there were 17 million unemployed in the European"
25731,"last year , it was 13 million ."
25732,"this year , however , the numbers are rising again ."
25733,"this is particularly evident in my country , Germany ."
25734,we must not get used to these heights .
25735,let me say beforehand that the part of the complex report that Mr Böge has dealt
25736,"it will be more difficult when we look at the TSE proposal , Mr Byrne ."
25737,"if we then ask questions directly , the questions that Mr Böge has already raised will come"
25738,the question will arise – and I will have to ask you and the Commission representatives in
25739,how will BSE status be defined in practice ?
25740,will you perhaps also consider the willingness to use a BSE test in the BSE
25741,"Mr President , I have been in this House for some time and I worked here before I was"
25742,"I remember , for example , the last and penultimate Italian Presidencies and others ."
25743,the Council has stayed here overnight and Question Time was held during the night sitting .
25744,I just want to remind you of that .
25745,"we then moved Question Time to the afternoon in consideration of the Council , with the result"
25746,"because this is the case , and because reason and realism could unfortunately not teach these"
25747,what I am trying to do is to give a soul to a process that could easily slip into
25748,we want to ensure peace and stability throughout Europe .
25749,we want to give young democracies the chance to participate on an equal footing in
25750,we want to further strengthen Europe 's role in international competition .
25751,there is no alternative .
25752,the balance sheet of enlargement negotiations since the Prodi Commission took office is positive .
25753,the progress reports that the Commission will present in the autumn will show that the candidate
25754,"until recently , the definition of sexual harassment has been fine-tuned , a"
25755,a compromise has been reached on the establishment of one or more independent bodies to
25756,"such bodies , which can also be part of existing institutions , are worthy of support"
25757,the directive also refers to the rights of adoptive parents in those Member States where ad
25758,"similarly , the right to return to the original job or an equivalent job after maternity"
25759,"however , we must also examine thoroughly – and here I contradict the previous speakers"
25760,thousands of jobs have been lost throughout the EU as a result of the restructuring
25761,"companies should certainly have the greatest possible freedom to make management decisions , but at"
25762,"the loss of jobs thus not only affects individual workers , but also has consequences for"
25763,I would like to remind you that the Nice European Council explicitly linked economic performance
25764,"competition law and policy must also take this into account , including in the context of mer"
25765,the greatest ambiguity in the Member States exists in relation to the maximum permissible
25766,"it is therefore the task of the Presidency and of the summit in Thessaloniki ,"
25767,"there are the Copenhagen criteria , and there is no reduction , no discount on those criteri"
25768,"but to do this , we must help the countries to carry out their economic reforms ."
25769,it has already been mentioned that the CARDS programme alone is not enough .
25770,"there is no question that Malta meets the Copenhagen political criteria and , as a functioning"
25771,"Malta also has stable , functioning democratic institutions ."
25772,the national action plan for the implementation of the acquis creates the necessary conditions for structura
25773,"secondly , if we are taking action against unfair ticket dumping practices outside the European"
25774,there are more and more cases where airlines offer at their own cost in order to conquer the
25775,will you attack that too ?
25776,"secondly , we have subsidiary directives on quality standards ."
25777,"in the area of noise policy in particular , we must examine very carefully what quality standard"
25778,we need to know exactly what dose is dangerous for people in the short and long term
25779,"therefore , subsidiary directives must be developed very carefully and , as a combined approach"
25780,"when I look at why this is the case , one of the main points of conflict is that"
25781,"you have the conflict between environmental , industrial and trade policy , and often between consumer protection and trade"
25782,the application forms I have before me are written by bureaucrats and not by people who
25783,so there is a need for additional money .
25784,"special loans and guarantee schemes are helpful , but many farmers no longer have the"
25785,"as we know , the EU will not spend 1 to 1.3 billion euros of"
25786,I would urge that consideration be given to the possibility of using the unused funds
25787,I am extremely sorry that there has been a political cow-bargaining in the run
25788,"I am reluctant to criticise a government that is close to me in political terms ,"
25789,"unfortunately , many European countries have always conducted Africa policy under the decisive criterion"
25790,"in countries like the Ivory Coast or the Congo , we can see what this actually leads"
25791,"I would warn you , Mr President-in-Office , that we should not – and I"
25792,"we need both , majority decision-making and enhanced cooperation !"
25793,we must remember to inform people about what their rights as citizens of the Union actually are and how
25794,"we must call for the necessary work to be done in the areas of schools , information office"
25795,so there is still a lot to do .
25796,we still have to work very hard to ensure that those who have European citizenship can actually feel
25797,we will also introduce the right to return to an adequate workplace after a childcare break
25798,we are once again introducing an amendment that also protects fathers who take parenta
25799,that is not enough .
25800,"around 2 % of fathers across Europe are taking this right , and these progressive"
25801,I hope that this amendment will receive broad support here .
25802,"in that sense , I see this as an important building block for gender mainstreaming ."
25803,"we Social Democrats want to break down old , oversized structures and stop reproducing"
25804,"I have now heard the alarm bells ring , because I also have the report on feed addi"
25805,as a logical consequence of the ban on nitrofurans in Regulation No 2
25806,"when this ban comes into force on 31 March , there will be a therapy stand"
25807,"there is no legal alternative available in the EU , neither as a feed additive nor as"
25808,"we have seen this in our immediate neighbourhood in Europe , in the former"
25809,"we must do everything we can to put out the fire that has been kindled there , so"
25810,we should always remember that we in Europe also experienced a similar fate decades ago .
25811,"we were sensible at the time and reached an agreement , and it is now our task to help"
25812,"I do , however , think it is right to review what we have achieved in the Balkan"
25813,"in principle , it should be noted , as previous speakers have done , that the Agency"
25814,"at the same time , however , we must say that the European Union 's policy must be"
25815,"as regards the butter case , I would like to say once again that it is fully under"
25816,"as regards the Stockholm case , which you also mentioned in your report , I can tell"
25817,I very much hope – and of course it is also in the Commission ’ s own interest –
25818,"we need to create binding legal regulations , similar to the private sector , which includes a"
25819,"of course , Mr Bangemann is personally responsible for his actions , but a policy"

25821,"this would mean that we would end up with 15 different national systems , thus completely"
25822,"in addition , there is the STOP programme for the period 1996 –"
25823,this is a funding and exchange programme for people responsible for measures against human trafficking
25824,this programme aims to develop coordinated initiatives to combat trafficking in human beings and the
25825,the Commission will draw up a proposal for a new edition of the STOP programme later this year

25831,Kosovo has nothing to do with Macedonia or Iraq .
25832,"I have been sitting here for half an hour now , waiting from 5.30"
25833,if there is now a demand that the Heads of Government should be involved and that they should
25834,the Heads of State or Government are not responsible at all .
25835,the European Commission is responsible for insisting that the Treaties are respected .
25836,and it does exactly what it has to do .
25837,I would like to expressly reiterate that I fully support the Commission 's position on

25839,that is why I am calling for the nuclear family to take precedence in several of my a

25845,it is not only a question of introducing new budget lines and of critically examining whether

25847,"I hope that today 's statements are not just a few , but that Parliament will also"
25848,I hope that we can expect a proposal from the Commission on chemicals policy in the near future
25849,one of the objectives of Johannesburg is to reverse the trend in the use of hazar
25850,I believe that the problems of chemicals policy also show that having our own committee on sustainable

25852,"as regards the economic criteria , progress is also clear ."
25853,"almost all of them can already be considered market economies , even though the economic reform process"
25854,but this is not only true for candidates .
25855,the focus of the report and the first objective of the Commission proposal is to emphasize
25856,"the text states that e-Europe is primarily intended to guide every citizen ,"
25857,but we do not see the target date as merely a window of opportunity for the candidate countries
25858,we also see the target date of 2004 as a means of putting pressure
25859,that is also the point of setting 2004 as the target date .
25860,"of course , we are talking – and here I agree with what Mr Verheugen , Mr"
25861,there are many points .
25862,but if we want to win the people of Europe over to support what we are going to do
25863,then we must also talk about what we all in Europe will gain from enlargement .
25864,"then let us talk about the fact that the reform of the common agricultural policy is ,"
25865,that is right .
25866,"in the Commission 's responses to last year 's report , it was stated ,"
25867,"given the fact that there have been significant shortcomings in this area as well , however"

25923,"I believe that the government policy and also the Commission policy still have some serious shortcomings ,"
25924,I would like to highlight five issues :
25925,"making the existing convergence criteria more flexible does not solve the problem ,"
25926,"we need a recast that takes into account other parameters such as the employment rate ,"
25927,"as for the question of the announcement by the Turkish Prime Minister , what Mr Ecevit"
25928,our answer is absolutely clear .
25929,"if there is no political agreement in Cyprus , firstly , if the Member States decide and Parliament"
25930,I do not see at the moment how we can get out of this crisis quickly .
25931,the second point is that we have seen dramatic developments in the European Union in the area of

25933,the European Union has become the world 's largest producer and exporter of synthetic drugs .

25965,"for the EU research budget , this means that the Seventh Framework Programme for Research must"

25969,"this is part of the Kyoto Protocol , which we want to ratify almost unanimously"

25971,everything that should be put on track here in the truest sense of the word is long
25972,we have talked about greener transport for far too long without taking the necessary measures
25973,we should therefore not be surprised if our roads are crowded and overcrowd

25977,"of course , the conflict over Chechnya is a major problem ."
25978,"however , we should be warned against unilaterally condemning Russia without addressing the background"

26045,all this is not a completely new phenomenon .
26046,"when I first moved into Parliament ten years ago , works councils of a cable fibre factory"
26047,their operation had been taken over shortly before by a large electrical company from France .

26084,let me briefly reiterate the main steps that the Commission has taken to improve financial management

26087,"in 2002 , for the first time , all directors-general presented"
26088,"I find it very regrettable that the Commissioner does not have so much time to listen , but"
26089,"in this regard , I was particularly impressed by the press release issued yesterday by"
26090,"according to Commissioner Fischler , people are now increasingly turning to cheap offers again after"
26091,this is exactly what my long-term experience confirms .
26092,"people have to pay attention to their budgets for reasons that are well known , and we"
26093,because economic efficiency has a decisive influence on everything we do .
26094,"as politicians who deal with Europe , we know from reality that national politicians are very"
26095,"this is easy , often well received , and usually there is no threat of correction ."
26096,I believe that information points on the European Union counteract this trend .

26102,"we therefore say ' yes ' to strengthening European debates in national parliaments , '"
26103,"but of course we say no to increasing bureaucracy , no to new bodies , no"
26104,we need more efficiency and professionalism of the existing in the interest of the common .
26105,this does not have to mean a reduction in freedom and freedom of decision in the Member States
26106,"we say no to prior information on tax collection or the use of tax revenues , because we"

26229,this must be combined with a thorough modernisation of its economy and state system .

26232,only if OLAF denies this will this office take action .

26539,I therefore ask that a technical adjustment be made .
26540,it is about re-establishing what we said at first reading .
26541,this is not a trick .
26542,who cheated here was the computer .
26543,"as always , the serious work is done by the Members of Parliament ."

26565,but this concern was not taken into account either .
26566,"I therefore believe that the European Parliament is right to reject the Commission proposal before us ,"

26571,no one has been able to tell me what is happening in the other Member States .

26573,that 's right !
26574,"in other Member States , no one tells me what happens with it ."
26575,some say it is burned .
26576,no one really knows .
26577,"no one knows the standards , and in private all the representatives tell you , yes"
26578,that is exactly what we do not want !
26579,I want to have a clear regulation .

26581,"here , too , we agree with the European Central Bank 's statement that one day , international"
26582,it is therefore extremely important that this gap be closed .

26593,"it was not the wish of the PPE , but rather the wish to postpone it was"

26599,"in this respect , the system mentioned by Mr Newton Dunn is to be welcomed and"
26600,"civilian conflict prevention , and I emphasise the word prevention , cannot be just"
26601,"it will be effective , above all , if we free ourselves from the trauma of Kosovo"
26602,this means that actions to reduce arms exports to unstable regions must be the first object
26603,promoting regional cooperation is also a useful means .
26604,"the EU has only one problem , namely that it has not so far won public interest in"

26610,"you can go to any drugstore in Germany wherever you want , you can go to any"
26611,I have nothing against that either .
26612,I have nothing against it remaining freely available .
26613,"but I want a maximum dose , yes , I want it !"

26641,I therefore propose that the costs be shared between the original holder and the manufacturer .
26642,"this directive , however , basically consists of two parts ."
26643,the second part is the question of how we will deal with dangerous products in the future

26687,"thank you , Mr Menrad , for a coherent and good report ."
26688,you have once again proven your worth in the field of workers ' issues .
26689,and whether this is a matter for the European Union !
26690,because employee participation has an absolutely innovative character on the entrepreneurial and employee
26691,that is the approach and that is the new philosophy if we want to follow Lisbon .
26692,that is to the previous speaker .
26693,"firstly , the report examines the effect of the instrument itself ."

26766,"like Parliament , the Council has recognised that mandatory labelling should be introduced ear"
26767,the Council has also joined Parliament in its demand to delete all references to EU origin .

26772,we have clearly discussed all these issues in the competent committee in the delegation and
26773,I myself was in Hungary four weeks ago and could see that the Hungarian Government is making an enorm

26775,today 's discussion is of course also primarily about the conditions in Serbian prisons .
26776,"there are more than 2,000 Kosovo Albanians in Serbian prisons , most"
26777,the situation in these prisons is indescribable .
26778,people have no legal advice .
26779,"when they are then convicted , they are convicted in disregard of the law ."
26780,"I remember Flora Brovina , the doctor who did nothing but follow her medical ethos and help"
26781,she was sentenced to 14 years in prison in Serbia in Niš .

26793,we discussed this issue with the representatives of the Member States on Monday and again today .
26794,we are sure that we will find a solution here that also corresponds to the practices .
26795,I am the last person who wants unsafe meat anywhere in this European Union .
26796,this Parliament has set up the Committee of Inquiry .
26797,"we then ensured that , in the context of the BSE debate , gaps that still"

26815,"what is absolutely necessary , however , and that is why we will vote in favour"

26890,"as a reminder , I would like to briefly outline the new action programme in the"
26891,the action programme aims to contribute to the creation of a European education area that promotes

26895,"their involvement in crisis centres - whether in Afghanistan , from which I have just returned today"

26903,we have to decide !

26945,thank you for your kind words .
26946,allow me to refer to Amendment No 45 .
26947,the minimum target for recycling of 25 % by weight seems to me to be perfect
26948,"you see , as an Austrian , I have no problem with this , but we have also"
26949,I believe that it makes more sense from an environmental point of view to set a target that can

26952,"from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy 's point of view and from"
26953,I can say quite clearly that there is no real positive development in the issues raised .
26954,"in connection with the confirmation of the death sentence against Öcalan , the Turkish Deputy Prime"
26955,this is clearly contrary to the obligations that Turkey has undertaken as a member of the

26957,"firstly , it must be a major disaster , and we must not have the illusion"
26958,I am sure that Minister Moscovici is absolutely right when he says that it is not

26961,"with a greater and better conscience of the population , we could have also conveyed a"
26962,this leads me to the conclusion that we will have to deal with this issue in general

26964,we have so many coordinators responsible to so many employers that we will soon have to

26969,I believe that this is the wrong way to go .
26970,"I think one thing is regrettable , however , that the working method of the Luxembourg process on"
26971,"it is also regrettable that the quality of the programmes has not been compared , which has"
26972,"I think that , if these points of view prevail , the development of the internal market and"
26973,this also applies to the coordination of tax processes .
26974,tax coordination worthy of its name must finally be implemented here .
26975,"we call on the parties involved , the Palestinians , the Israelis and the international community ,"
26976,this alone serves human rights in the Middle East !
26977,my second point concerns the duration of authorisation .
26978,"we support an indefinite authorisation , provided that the safety of the products is not affect"
26979,"therefore , a re-evaluation of additives should be carried out every ten years"
26980,this means reliability for the applicants on the one hand and safety for the animals and consumer
26981,"Mr President , we are constantly seeing that in the field of biotechnology we are actually"
26982,"for more than 20 years , only promises have been made that cannot be kept in"
26983,genetically modified foods and agricultural products are a flop .
26984,they are not wanted by consumers .
26985,"in the field of medicine , it is mainly counterfeit products , where only the production"
26986,we base our fisheries agreements on the available surplus stocks that the third country
26987,the Commission also expressly agrees that the principle of sustainable management of natural resources must be

26989,"finally , I must also reject the last Amendment , Amendment No"
26990,of course - and this must not be a question at all - safety must be guaranteed .
26991,the current rules also allow a vessel in distress to call a port other than the prescribed
26992,I believe that this approach is already balanced and takes due account of the safety of ships
26993,I am pleased that the directive also contains a revision clause .
26994,"in this context , I would ask the Commission to take this very seriously ."
26995,we in Parliament will of course also follow developments in e-business closely and will support
26996,I think that our amendments from first reading have been taken into account in a very satisfac

26998,I would ask for your support for the amendment proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy
26999,"by not setting a specific date for the Member States to transpose the directive , but by"
27000,I ask you to approve it .
27001,"in terms of content , the Commission still has a debt to pay ."
27002,Mr Galeote 's report and the decisions of the committees requested to give their
27003,"Madam President , I believe that , in the face of such a question and such an important situation"
27004,this formal question is not important enough .
27005,"it is right that we should make something clear in this House this week , immediately after"
27006,"we could do this as Mr Cox suggested , namely only in the debate ."
27007,but it is the tradition of this Parliament that we normally want to do this in a resolution
27008,"the Heads of State and Government of the Fourteen have , by their actions , truly"
27009,"more than a year ago , it seemed that the catastrophically low turnout in"

27012,it has been held on virtually all the important issues with which the Commission is concerned in
27013,"Mr President , this Supplementary and Amending Budget 5 / 99 is an important step"
27014,I am pleased that this time the expert recommendations of the OLAF Supervisory Committee
27015,"as we have heard , this has not always been the case ."
27016,this has been corrected and that is good for OLAF .
27017,it underlines our desire to ensure OLAF 's independence .
27018,the decision on filling these posts will be made by the future Director of OLAF .
27019,"that is why the third point is essential , it is an essential part of what we are put"
27020,the setting of an ambitious timetable for full market opening .
27021,"the timetable that we have now set together with the Council is ambitious , and if"
27022,Austria cannot deal with the problem of the entire zone alone .
27023,one can be divided about the ecopoints .
27024,they were an instrument .
27025,"one can accuse Austria of not having done its homework , of not having sought and"
27026,"his activities were perhaps a little too sparse , the capacities of the railroad"
27027,maybe .
27028,the majority in the committee supported the Commission 's intention to regulate competition only in individual
27029,"however , the report is ambiguous on one point , namely whether pilotage services should"
27030,"on the one hand , Amendment 14 of the committee report states that piloting"
27031,"in this respect , we as Parliament must set a clear line tomorrow ."
27032,I believe that this should show us that we should also be active in the Committee on Budgets
27033,"as a member of the Committee on Budgets , I have tabled a proposal together with the"
27034,"in particular , guarantees of up to EUR 25 000 should be made"
27035,we want to focus on a package of two or three digits in order to help small businesses
27036,"we want a training package , especially for the finance ministries ."
27037,"as with the Lisbon process , we need to look at the impact of tax law on the various"
27038,"there is a lot to be examined here , and I call on the Commission to address these"
27039,2001 was far from a good year for the Structural Funds .
27040,it shows clearly that the main objectives of the 1999 reform of
27041,"firstly , as with the last reform , there were again considerable delays in the transition"
27042,"secondly , the authorisation and administrative procedures have not been simplified , as was original"
27043,"thirdly , the approach of decentralising the day-to-day management of the"
27044,the situation is indeed alarming .
27045,the next step is for the Commission to present a directive that distributes the burden among
27046,so we need quotas .
27047,"these quotas must , however , be accompanied by sanctions , otherwise they"
27048,"in other words , we will have a common energy policy by the detour of environmental policy ."
27049,in 2005 we could start this emissions trading within the European Union .
27050,"again , I hope that this scenario will be more or less adhered to and that we"
27051,"in this sense , we should support the Commission and also be as united as possible ."
27052,"I would like to point out one aspect in this context , namely that the great country of"
27053,"dialogue between cultures , especially between the United States of America and the Islamic world , sometimes"
27054,"I think we have a great potential if France in particular , together with Canada , promotes this"
27055,Canada can be a mediator between the US and the Islamic world .
27056,"this is not least in the interests of our most important partner , namely the United States"
27057,these companies are usually poorly equipped with equity capital .
27058,"the construction , tourism and catering sectors are particularly affected ."
27059,"the equity ratio of the catering industry in Austria , for example , is only 1"
27060,"however , since the equity ratio is supposed to be decisive for granting credit in"
27061,the consequences would be catastrophic .
27062,the companies would no longer be able to invest and modernize and would have to close .
27063,"we would lose thousands , if not thousands , of businesses and jobs ."
27064,"I can only agree with the rapporteur when he calls for an analysis of these effects , so"
27065,"since the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam , Austria has made it clear that it want"
27066,we welcome every step in a feasible direction and therefore also support General Morillon 's
27067,I am deeply convinced that the health problem that undoubtedly exists in relation
27068,only if we are able to convince consumers will tobacco consumption also fall .
27069,it is an illusion to believe that this issue can be managed from the supply side .
27070,"economically speaking , this is only possible from the demand side ."
27071,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission continues to pay great attention to the"
27072,"current and future work , in particular the study by the Directorate-General for Regional Policy ,"
27073,"what we must do now , however , is to press for the rapid implementation of all these"
27074,I would also like to take this opportunity to point out what has developed less positively .
27075,that is usually the working situation in this House .
27076,cooperation with the Council leaves much to be desired .
27077,"documents are increasingly being submitted too late or not at all , which then leads"
27078,"the Council often shines through its absence at important committee meetings , but also in plena"
27079,"an example is Monday , when we met in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights"
27080,"the Council was absent , and there was no written information for discussion ."
27081,"this is unacceptable , to say the least , in terms of the cooperation situation here"
27082,globalisation and industrial change bring social problems with them .
27083,"however , they can also be a source of prosperity for people and regions if the change is"
27084,the main challenge for governments and the Community is to strike a balance between promoting business innovation
27085,"finally , I would like to say to my fellow Members from Sweden that we welcome"
27086,"we will do everything we can to accompany them on this path , but please under the conditions"
27087,if the government has not yet met these requirements – independence for the Central Bank or the question
27088,"in this sense , we have every reason to thank the Commission for its course ."
27089,I would like to highlight paragraph 20 of the report in particular .
27090,it contains a clear commitment to the rights of every Member to request and receive information from the
27091,this commitment to the rights of the individual Member is particularly important because it is precisely
27092,"it is quite worrying , Commissioner , that the Commission , as guardian of the Treat"

27096,"Mr President , I would like to request a separate vote on Amendment No 44"
27097,I would therefore like to request a split vote between the first and second amendments .
27098,"I firmly believe that after the elections in the Turkish part of Cyprus , a window of opportunity"
27099,I even think that it would help the current Turkish Government if such a message were sent to it
27100,"of course , we cannot change the applicable law and the jurisdiction of the courts ,"
27101,this is a very big step forward .
27102,we also need to make provision for the budget .
27103,"one BSE test for all animals , co-financed by the Community , means EUR"
27104,"at the same time , reserves must be kept in case restructuring measures are required"
27105,we will also be conducting the trialogue and budgetary conciliation with the Commission

27121,"having , so to speak , managed the European company , I would like to remind"
27122,I hope that the Commission will soon make proposals in this regard .
27123,is it due to the forecasts for growth and employment in the coming years ?
27124,the forecasts are quite good .
27125,economic growth is forecast at 3 % compared to 1.9 % in the

27127,price stability in the European Union is better in the eleven member states than in the United

27129,long-term interest rates are also lower than in the United States .
27130,"the book is not just a commodity , but has a cultural value , we all agree on"
27131,but what is the Commission doing to this end ?
27132,"I too cannot relieve you , Mr Competition Commissioner , of your responsibility for cultural"
27133,it is not possible that we all strictly look only in one direction of decision and not to

27135,but that does not seem to be the case .
27136,"however , we must not forget that Saddam Hussein is a mass murderer ."
27137,"I went to an Iraqi refugee camp in Iran with Baroness Nicholson , and I"
27138,to present Saddam Hussein now as if he did not pose a real danger does not seem cred

27140,"do you think that we can continue the internal functioning of our institutions , of the Council ,"

27851,"Mr President , if you will allow me , I would like to begin by expressing my respect"
27852,I thought that was excellent .
27853,I will now turn briefly to the considerations relating to enlargement .
27854,Mr Mulder asks the Commission to make every effort to help the candidate countries to meet the
27855,"at the same time , however , he insists that candidate countries should not benefit from agricultura"
27856,I can only agree with the rapporteur on this point .
27857,I too firmly believe that the Commission 's strategy of dealing with any problems in the
27858,"we also demand that , if the Agency 's work is to be extended to other areas"
27859,this cannot be done by a decision of the Council alone .
27860,we no longer accept faits accomplis that we have not been asked about !
27861,"this also includes the European Centres mentioned , which I believe have been a great success ."
27862,"the issue of consolidation is important , but the right perspective is also important ."
27863,I think you have raised an important point here .
27864,we have achieved a great deal in political cooperation under the Clinton administration .
27865,"however , we have also seen that trade policy and , above all , trade disputes have increasing"
27866,I am voting in favour of setting up a genuine committee of inquiry to investiga
27867,the Commission has carefully examined Parliament 's amendments .
27868,"many of them are acceptable to us , at least in substance , others are not in"
27869,"unfortunately , we cannot accept others ."
27870,"the directive on the organisation of working time of mobile road transport workers , which is being debate"
27871,"from the point of view of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs , and especially self"
27872,"in their view , it is even an urgent , dirigist obstacle that contradicts the"
27873,"the sin also has a name , because the representative of the UN Secretary-General - the"
27874,we must say that openly here .
27875,"that is why we not only offer our good services to resolve conflicts , but we are also"
27876,"firstly , we wanted to promote encryption software based on open source , so that you"
27877,we wanted the Commission to help spread open source software so that we can be sure that there are
27878,the Commission is doing too little in this respect .
27879,"incidentally , to my regret , neither you nor the European Parliament use open source software"
27880,"in this context , I would like to stress that the employment rate of Cypriot women"
27881,measures must be taken to promote women 's access to vocational training and
27882,"with OLAF and the Bösch report , we have taken a major step towards fraud control ."
27883,I think we should move away from the slogan that fraud is at home in Brussels .
27884,fraud is not at home in Brussels !
27885,"there are cases of fraud , as with all large institutions ."
27886,what was not enough at home was the clear detection and prosecution of fraud .
27887,"and , Mr Poettering , Commissioner Kinnock has already said , especially as regards whistle"
27888,"in this sense , Commissioner Kinnock , I hope that we will soon have this regulation ."
27889,we did not understand that it was necessary for Brussels to put the whole agricultural
27890,"thank God , we have now managed to get somewhat on track , but we have not"
27891,I hope that this will be clarified so that we will know what we have really decided after
27892,the East Timorese who have fled and are now in West Timor must be able to return
27893,"they must be protected in West Timor , where they are now ."
27894,we must therefore send a clear signal to those in charge in Indonesia .
27895,I am no longer sure that the government still has the responsibility and control .
27896,maybe she has the army .
27897,"we must tell all those responsible that if there is no change in Indonesian policy , and that"
27898,"otherwise , we would see that our UN troops are stationed there , but people are"
27899,"Furthermore , in the context of comitology , a subject which is of great interest"
27900,we are not taking part in this game either .
27901,we need structural reforms in the European economy .
27902,"above all , we need a European economy in which performance is rewarded once again by people"
27903,"it would be a disaster for Europe if , in the end , only a few multinational"
27904,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the general rapporteur , Mr Casaca , for"
27905,"on behalf of the Commission , I would also like to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Sta"
27906,"overall , the Regulation will contribute to a clearer structure for granting aid to"
27907,"I think that the Council would do well to ask us for advice , because we have to"
27908,I think that the Commission is basically of the same opinion as us - we should not start
27909,"then we will be ready to immediately seek negotiations with them , in which all"
27910,I would like to remind you that we are there more often than not throughout the year and
27911,"I am therefore very grateful that we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights"
27912,I would be very happy if that would be the case again tomorrow !
27913,let us be aware of the fact that reducing the existing deficits is a task for
27914,further measures must therefore follow .
27915,"of course , the border regions are now moving to the centre of Europe , and of course this"
27916,"there is a chance to become a model region of European cooperation , that is right , but"
27917,"until then , we have to help ."
27918,let us set a sign and put this report on a broad basis of approval in this House
27919,it is a sign to the citizens of these difficult regions that we are not sacrificing them to
27920,we are also forward-looking in this budget .
27921,"that is why we in the PSE Group can say that we are very , very satisfi"
27922,what we have achieved is that we want to deal with VAT fraud in Europe in future
27923,"in this respect , financial resources that can be generated must also be generated ."
27924,"we will continue to promote small and medium-sized enterprises next year , as we"
27925,what were the main shortcomings ?
27926,"firstly , there is an unacceptably high rate of so-called direct contracts"
27927,we note that steps have been taken which will hopefully change this situation soon .
27928,the committee also proposes that the public should be better informed in future and that the propose
27929,I think that if we manage to achieve this in such a way that the Commission can hopefully
27930,we want to see better air quality in Europe and thus make a major contribution to health
27931,"as regards humanitarian aid , the Commission and the Community Member States have already reite"
27932,"we would like to congratulate you not only on your work and your record , but above"
27933,"I also congratulate you on the success of the introduction of the euro in cash , where"
27934,"like other Members who come from Objective 1 regions , I am particularly concerned"
27935,they should be entitled to the same financial and aid support as they were before en

27941,the use of risk analysis techniques will be further improved .
27942,"the aid received , which is used as a threshold for verification , should be"
27943,"I am therefore very grateful that this will also take place across Member States , because"
27944,"we should soon send a delegation from the European Parliament to Chechnya and the region ,"
27945,"I would also welcome you , Commissioner , to go there personally and talk to those affected"
27946,"in an informal trialogue last week , the Council informed us that it can accept"
27947,for a long time it seemed impossible to reach an agreement .
27948,"positions were very far apart here in Parliament , but also between Member States and between the various"

27950,I would therefore like to express my sympathy to all the citizens and regions that have been

27952,the issue now is to process this damaged wood as quickly as possible .
27953,everyone knows that even greater catastrophes can occur here if the damaged

27955,"therefore , the processing of damaged wood is absolutely necessary before the beginning of the"
27956,"we need a Commission – and this is my deepest conviction , not a party polemic"
27957,"the common position is not too weak , in some places we even think it is too strict"
27958,the general limitation of the authorisation of release to 10 years is impractic

27960,a brief comment : I would like to point out that the English text has been worked on .
27961,"in Amendment No 12 , part of the amendment withdrawn by"
27962,Spiritual enterprises should be included in the investigation of the activities .
27963,this carries a little danger that we will suddenly have youth sects in the program .
27964,that part of the amendment was withdrawn in committee .
27965,"I would ask that the language versions be checked , with the English text as the basis ."
27966,that is why one of the amendments calls on the Commission in particular to make available in
27967,this is a sort of ceterum censeo which should be the subject of the deliberations
27968,"however , Mrs Schreyer , I would have liked to have heard from you , not"
27969,when will you provide us with the figures you promised the Committee on Budgetary Control more
27970,are you still holding to your statement that there was no evidence of the involvement of the

27972,I have also asked Mr Lamy this question in writing and have not received any answer .
27973,"in cases such as these , which need to be noted with criticism , I would really"
27974,"Mr Södermann , I would also like to ask you , and I have written this in"
27975,I can only thank you once again very much for your work .
27976,I would like to extend my thanks to your staff .
27977,I believe that it has become a very central building block for the further development of this European Union
27978,"other points are , of course , the Intergovernmental Conference and the relationship between enlargement"
27979,they are bound by a mandate .
27980,"on the other hand , however , experience has shown that once one of the parties involved in"
27981,"that is to say , the practice and also the possibilities that you have give you the opportunity"
27982,I believe that it would be extremely helpful for the decisions we have to make in
27983,this would give us a greater opportunity to present our ideas of democracy and the European Union'
27984,"Madam President , I am pleased that the Commission says that it can accept Amendment No"
27985,"but I would like to know from the Council once again whether it can accept this , if that"

27997,the proposal was presented by the European Commission in December 1998 .
27998,the Finnish Presidency made serious efforts to make use of the new legal possibilities provided for by

28006,Mrs Riis-Jørgensen is here and the situation in the Council is similar to
28007,there is a great deal of controversy in the Member States as to whether the Commission has

28009,"I assume that the vast majority will continue to hold this view in future , but I would ask"
28010,Mr Brok raised a second point that is very important to me .
28011,I think that the time of conferences and quick start packages should finally be over in the
28012,the Stability Pact should be closely linked to the work of the Agency for Reco
28013,"this Stability Pact should therefore be attached to the Commission , where all the work"
28014,"we could then avoid frictional losses , we could create synergies and we could"
28015,"for example , the great opportunities for cooperation in the energy sector could be created ."
28016,"we could advance the free trade zone down there , the development of transport infrastructure and the fight against"
28017,"secondly , farmers are worried about whether the FMD vaccination has been abolished definitiv"
28018,what are the considerations in this regard in the current situation for stocks in general and for
28019,"secondly , the Member States must agree at the European Council in Brussels in a few days"
28020,"I came back yesterday from Luxembourg , where the Finance Ministers ' Council had not shown"
28021,"therefore , the Member States must also be urged to show the necessary willingness to"
28022,"if we are to meet the timetable , we need agreement in Brussels on the financial package"
28023,"the Russian Government would do well to look at examples , some of which are in its own"
28024,"we must say that too , we must be honest with our partners and we must tell them the"
28025,"secondly , we must support all the groups at home and abroad that are working to change"
28026,I sometimes compare this - even though it is not entirely comparable to the situation there -
28027,the sum of EUR 971 million is divided as follows : EUR 7
28028,"to say it straight away , I am in favour of adopting the proposed supplementary"
28029,it has been modified because we want to encourage the Member States to take on greater responsibility
28030,"I am therefore in favour , even though I can understand those Members who want to"
28031,the compromise solution found after extensive discussions with the rapporteur and the adoption of

28033,I welcome the fact that the 75 % limit of GDP per capita at NUTS II

28035,"overnight , from April 30 to May 1 next year , poor people will become"
28036,this is called the statistical effect .
28037,these regions continue to need Structural Funds to consolidate and continue the economic and social
28038,"that is why the report , based on the amendments we tabled in committee , clear"
28039,"we are very grateful to the rapporteur for being willing , in the spirit of compromis"
28040,"we now only have one final appeal to make to the Council , which should also be careful"
28041,"this appeal is addressed in particular to the finance ministers , who bear responsibility for this"
28042,I can now present a compromise package which the Council is prepared to accept by a large
28043,I think that we should go that way in this case and finish the whole legislation at one
28044,"this will , on the one hand , reduce the bureaucratic burden on the European Parliament"
28045,"Mr President , the result has been achieved after a whole series of breaches of the"
28046,the Rules of Procedure have been repeatedly violated by the services and by
28047,"moreover , the result is a black day for Parliament because what the majority of Parliament has decided"
28048,I do not allow myself to be made a civil servant by my own Parliament .
28049,"if I also consider that , according to this text , Members are to be obliged to"

28051,whether another convention would be a suitable instrument for the much more complex issue of a European
28052,the involvement of national parliaments is of course welcome .
28053,"I personally doubt , however , that a reasonable result can be achieved on such"
28054,I think the rapporteur 's suggestion to set priorities is extremely sensible .
28055,"the final status of Kosovo needs to be clarified urgently , as does the constitutional structure"
28056,"before that , negotiations on an association agreement simply cannot take place ."
28057,the unclear status of Kosovo is a latent source of uncertainty .
28058,it also leads to the economy not having any confidence in the situation and not investing
28059,"this in turn leads to increased corruption and thus to increased emigration trends , a"
28060,"one of the most important prerequisites , and this applies to the whole area ,"
28061,future EU missions will always have a strong civilian-military dimension and will take place
28062,that is what makes the European Union special - and what distinguishes us from a purely

28064,it describes how the images of the old perpetrators are worshipped in Palestinian schools as
28065,have we really done enough to control the terror that has been hitting Israel for years ?
28066,that is why I do not believe that it is enough to demand that the Israelis withdraw
28067,"they must , without any doubt , but that alone does not ensure peace ."
28068,it is not enough to condemn Palestinian terror without doing more than making paper declarations .
28069,there is much to suggest that the parties will not be able to break free from their mutual
28070,the European Union must also stand up for this .
28071,"one last word , Mr President : anyone who really wants to do something to keep women in"
28072,"we want and need compulsory independent insurance for the millions of assisting spouses , and"
28073,"Mr President , a month before the publication of the next progress reports , I will not"
28074,"as my group 's shadow rapporteur for Lithuania , I would like to congratulate"
28075,"I would like to address a number of expectations and concerns , in particular to the Council"
28076,"finally , I would like to support all those who have called for a courageous position"
28077,"I would like to emphasise , however , that these are not only ACP countries ,"
28078,I am one of those who are in favour of a complete duty-free regime for all
28079,national and European targets are needed to achieve these policy objectives .
28080,"Furthermore , I believe that there is a need for greater cooperation between businesses and"
28081,"just as red genetic engineering is not only associated with opportunities , green genetic engineering is not only"
28082,there is a realistic chance that we will make great progress in the field of renewable

28084,"so in both areas , we should take advantage of the opportunities and limit the risks by"
28085,the development resulting from research into the human genome – for which we have hardly any
28086,the PPE Group will vote in favour of the Bowe report .
28087,my last point is that we in this House are of course aware that the question of Turkey is
28088,"if we can achieve that Turkey becomes more open and cooperative in the case of Cyprus ,"
28089,"I would like to say clearly in this House , at least on behalf of our group"
28090,"despite these difficulties , I would like to say that for the first time since the Second"
28091,"we should seize this opportunity , knowing that it is not easy ."
28092,"it is a noble task , not a dirty one , but a noble one that"
28093,"what is it that is at stake in the context of the Ainardi report , for which I"
28094,interoperability should and must be achieved throughout the network .
28095,"we cannot concentrate , as we did when we started , on treating individual parts - high"
28096,"we must try to find a structure , of course with the necessary exceptions for regional railway"
28097,"this intellectual and political isolation , economic sanctions and the ever-increasing material"
28098,"Mr President , second reading , restriction of certain dangerous substances and preparations ."
28099,I think we should ask ourselves what we actually need this extremely important product for .
28100,"well , PentaBDE is used exclusively for the production of a soft foam for furniture and"
28101,a certainly extremely important area .
28102,the Council 's common position is generally in line with the Commission 's amended proposal and
28103,I voted in favour of the accession treaties in protest and only out of solidarit
28104,I believe that we as Parliament must set a milestone here with our vote and – as the
28105,"the most recent reports , the most recent disputes with the United Nations , with states in"
28106,"I can only urge the Commissioner to remain strict with the US , and I would like to"
28107,"above all , we must not lift the moratorium , especially as you know that only one"
28108,we wanted to create a balance between the European Voluntary Service and Youth for Europe .
28109,"the amendments proposed by Parliament should bring the programme closer to young people and ,"
28110,our priorities were and are : increasing the budget for the programme – the Commission had proposed
28111,"our amendments aimed at simplifying the structures , improving communication with the"
28112,"yes , why not ?"
28113,a second problem worries me .
28114,the narrowing of monetary and financial policy to price stability is reflected in the
28115,"I would like to say about the Erasmus programme , which is part of the Socrates programme , that"
28116,it has already been said that this insight will unfortunately no longer be incorporated into
28117,"I think we could have updated this , because after all , 40 % of the Socrates"
28118,"in the country I come from , people are extremely cautious about criticising Israel"
28119,it is easier to describe terrorism and executions on the part of the Palestinians and
28120,but remember : the one who has lived for more than 35 years in a refugee
28121,the rights and archives of broadcasters are of immeasurable cultural and historical
28122,"for this reason , we must do everything possible to make these archives available for online use"
28123,"I therefore urge you to support Article 11 , and I do not agree with"
28124,I do believe that it is justified to offer a special arrangement for public broadcasting .
28125,we need vocational education and training in its most modern form .
28126,"continuing education , training and lifelong learning are necessary ."
28127,"in order to create more and better jobs , the adaptability of enterprises to cope"
28128,"I would also like to stress , Commissioner , that the Committee on Budgetary Control is keen that"
28129,this is one of the essentials for us when we have to decide on it in October .
28130,"I would also like to make it clear that all these issues are not about , or were not"
28131,I think that Dr. Busek is one of our most outstanding employees – in the
28132,"you can rest assured that if he were to be re-nominated , he would certain"
28133,"if someone else is nominated , we will of course look at the matter ourselves"
28134,I would like to accept the proposal made by the Commission and I will also recommend to Parliament tomo
28135,"this would give us what the Commission and you , Commissioner , want , namely operational capacity"
28136,the funding for the new so-called Marco Polo programme has also been included .
28137,this is Community financial aid for improving the environmental performance of freight transport systems .
28138,"finally , as an example of category 3 , let me mention that measures for an"
28139,I believe that this is yet another example of how the priority of promoting sustainable development

28141,hardly a day passes without the Middle East being dragged deeper into the downward

28143,"it must apply to everyone equally , to Israelis as well as Palestinians , and"
28144,"the signs are not very encouraging , however ."
28145,"the Oslo process has run a dead end , and the Quartet 's road map is also"
28146,"with the draft fifth motor vehicle directive , we want to further improve the protection of"

28149,"the Commission 's proposals on the development of railway undertakings , on the granting"
28150,"I can only give my full support to my colleague , Georg Jarzembowski ,"
28151,I believe that it is important that investments in the network be carefully considered and compensated

28159,they are a founding member of the European Union .
28160,Belgium has already successfully managed eleven Presidencies .
28161,we wish Belgium every success for its twelfth Presidency .
28162,we are at your side !
28163,"that is what I wanted to say , and by my abstention I wanted to say that"
28164,it was also important to me to send a signal that would be correctly understood in

28428,we are therefore also under massive pressure in the area of administrative expenditure .
28429,"in short , this means that everything that was so grandly announced by the Heads of State"

28441,"transferring Eurojust to the first pillar is a necessary condition in this respect , but"
28442,that must be said very clearly .

28445,competition distortions on the sales markets lead to job and income losses .
28446,all the price lines are falling apart and no one can explain it .

28512,there are a large number of bilateral issues that need to be resolved directly with the respective country
28513,this ranges from extremely difficult issues such as the whole competition problem with Poland and Hungary to

28517,this would be an effective contribution to supporting and stimulating the regional and local small and

28520,I agree with that .
28521,I am in favour of having a referendum on the Constitution in all our Member States .
28522,I would like to point out to all of you that there is an initiative in this regard
28523,I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work .
28524,the report mainly focuses on the essential points and fits well into existing legislation
28525,"however , allow me to make a general comment at this point on the formal structure of the report"
28526,I wonder whether the technical criteria listed in the annex should really be discussed by
28527,without the explanation of a specialist - at least that is how it has been for
28528,I think that in such a case technical reports should perhaps be brought into line in future
28529,"another point is the increased Community support in assessing the need for additional initiatives , including ,"
28530,"the European Parliament , the national parliaments and networks must therefore be more closely involved"
28531,"financial resources are – as everywhere , if you want to achieve goals and have a need"
28532,it is therefore essential that this programme be provided with a budget of EUR 50 million
28533,this requires us to make more intensive efforts to promote a cross-institutional and cross
28534,the energy of our work must be invested in the development and implementation of the programmes
28535,we expect an annual report from the President of the Commission in the context of an annual debate in
28536,"Furthermore , it is necessary to set up a Council of Ministers , both for"
28537,women 's policy as an appendix to other political issues cannot underline the seriousness
28538,"I am here today to replace Mr Wuermeling , who drafted the opinion for the"
28539,"he also warned against hasty and over-hasty centralism , however , and point"
28540,"the Commission should , above all , once again elaborate very precisely on the disadvantages"
28541,"from the year 2000 onwards , we intend to provide support of EUR"
28542,"these subsidies are not only intended for the decommissioning measures themselves , however"
28543,"in Lithuania , for example , market liberalisation and technical modernisation are needed in the non-"
28544,"finally , I would like to say something about the legislative proposals in general ."
28545,"Madam Vice-President , you know that you are our partner in the debate on alternative forms"
28546,we in this Parliament have an interest in seeing laws passed more quickly and in managing
28547,I will say something about it in a moment .
28548,"as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , I would like to make one further point"
28549,we have voted on Amendment No 3 .
28550,there was an oral amendment that was agreed with the Commission .
28551,"I will not go into details now , but this was not included in the report ."
28552,I would like to put on record my wish that this be clarified and that we then have
28553,"as I said , this was done in consultation with the Commission ."
28554,"ladies and gentlemen , this also requires that Mr Blix 's inspectors have"
28555,"I think that Mr Blix should be told this now , because how can we explain to our"
28556,"it seems to me that a certain credibility gap is building up here , which could cause"
28557,"it has not been enough to reduce cod catches in recent years , and unfortunately ,"
28558,the scientists have also pointed to this .
28559,"it is not just a conjecture of the Commission , as some have claimed ."
28560,"scientists have repeatedly warned that we must not only set quotas , but"
28561,it is therefore all the more incomprehensible that women are denied access to
28562,I remember the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta .
28563,"on behalf of the EPP Group , I spoke out here in the House against discrimination"
28564,they wanted to take off their headscarves and the clothing that prevents them from walk
28565,that was denied them at the time .
28566,"I hope that this will not happen again in Athens , dear Anne Karamanou ."
28567,the Heads of State or Government will have a chance to do so at the next Council in
28568,I hope they will use it for the benefit of Europe !
28569,"secondly , in the context of budgetary policy , we are currently dealing with countries that"
28570,what programs do you think could be used to get the problems under control again ?
28571,"Mr President , Commissioner , this storm at the turn of the millennium is basically me"
28572,it has become clear that humans are still not able to avoid natural disasters .
28573,natural disasters have always existed and will continue to exist .
28574,"of course , solidarity is needed in this context ."
28575,there is certainly a need for a European civil protection force and there must also be a budget
28576,"all this must be done , and quickly ."
28577,"if we do not help quickly , the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis"
28578,"I therefore think it is right that we have acted quickly , that we have acknow"
28579,"but we want to see action and we also want to see success in Kosovo , and I ask"
28580,although I have doubts as to whether this indicative instrument is really sufficient to achieve efficiency
28581,"if the European level wants to be taken seriously , they must do so too !"
28582,the last point : the awarding advisory board .
28583,it is the advisory body that must be consulted before contracts are awarded .
28584,this House decided at its last part-session in Strasbourg to reform this procedure .
28585,"I believe that we are making ourselves uncredible if we now , 14"
28586,"if we do not vote on the report , there will be delays ."
28587,"it will hinder trade in vine planting material in Europe , and I think that we must"
28588,"reconstruction is now our obligation , our responsibility , and we Europeans will probably"
28589,only if we find an answer will we regain credibility in this context .
28590,"our resolution is intended to advance Taiwanese democracy , but the People 's Republic of China consider"
28591,"I therefore seriously wonder whether we should not sometimes take a different path , one that recon"
28592,"on behalf of many people , I would like to thank the public sector , the local author"
28593,civil society has proven itself and has been successful .
28594,but she is not finished with her work yet .
28595,"the Austrian Chancellor , Dr Schüssel , was able to report yesterday that 7"
28596,"the head of the Austrian delegation , Ursula Stenzel , took the initiative for"
28597,"I would like to mention two other points , however ."
28598,"the abolition of export refunds for slaughter animals , which is the subject of this resolution"
28599,"in the past , Parliament has already achieved that , when export refunds are paid , me"
28600,"for example , only about half of the export refund paid for live animals is currently paid ,"
28601,"but that is not enough , and export refunds for slaughter animals should be reduced to"
28602,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
28603,"I think I speak on behalf of all of us here today , and we are more than"
28604,"we need this impetus , and we need their inner readiness ."
28605,"it is not just an external signal that we are sending , but it must also be support"
28606,"we want to do our part , but we will have to come up with something to influence the"
28607,my proposal to the Member States is therefore to replace the unnecessary bureaucratic
28608,less is sometimes more !
28609,I am very pleased that two issues that I have repeatedly advocated have been included
28610,"my request to the Commission would be to bring this work together under one roof , if possible ."
28611,"the second is the issue of disarmament , a contribution to the disarmament of"
28612,"if you look at today 's newspapers , you will read that the two former superpower"
28613,it would be a noble task for the European Union to contribute to this .
28614,"finally , there are a few amendments which we believe are simply too bureaucratic"
28615,"in summary , our group opposes elements which are counterproductive in achieving the great"
28616,"in conclusion , I would like to reiterate the good cooperation and I am pleased"
28617,this brings me to my second point .
28618,"yes , in our group we are in favour of increasing consultation with civil society , whatever"
28619,"I just wonder , Mr President , whether the Commission has the human resources to manage it to the"
28620,at least you do not say how you intend to achieve this .
28621,"secondly , you say hardly anything about how this is to be done together with Parliament ."
28622,"yes , you mention that Parliament has already started this process , too , correctly ."
28623,we also need to strengthen it .
28624,"but we must tackle things together , as you have said today , because the citizens experience the"
28625,I would therefore ask you to make proposals on how you envisage this dialogue being
28626,"as it is described , this will lead to an inflation of consultation processes ,"
28627,but we are ready to talk with you about exactly that .
28628,"Mrs Schreyer , I am of course in favour of the possibility of restructur"
28629,I would immediately reorient my policy from large enterprises to jobs-saving
28630,I would immediately move from supply-oriented economic policy to demand-oriented economic
28631,"this applies to all candidate countries , certainly to varying degrees , but it also appli"
28632,that is why I find it all the more regrettable that the current Austrian Government has not
28633,"of course , the focus is again on the past ."
28634,I hope that after the elections on Sunday in Austria we will have a government that places the common
28635,"Mr President , I agree with the rapporteur on the main points and , in the short time"
28636,"what we need first of all is coherent , homogeneous legislation at European Union level ."
28637,this is often not the case because terms are used that have a different meaning in other legal text
28638,"in general , this Community law is hardly researched scientifically in this sense ."
28639,that is why you should first ensure coherence and homogeneity in your own legal text
28640,that is one aspect .
28641,I should therefore like to express my special thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur
28642,"unlike the discharge procedure for the Commission , we do not have to complain that we"
28643,"we may have received some a little late , but we have received them all ."
28644,this is also a difference from the discharge procedure .
28645,"we as Parliament certainly have to criticise and address mismanagement in certain areas , but"
28646,"it was therefore right to say that we want an independent agency , and I believe it was"
28647,"only 14 % of observers from the accession countries , only 17 %"
28648,"in the European Parliament , we do not have a single female Director-General , but 7"
28649,in our resolution on gender mainstreaming we have proposed a whole series of actions which provide
28650,"since this is not guaranteed by the report before us , I have voted against it ."
28651,"I really want to say here , Mr Farage , that it would be better if you based"
28652,for what is the truth ?
28653,the truth is that we have incorporated a whole series of new measures into this agreement
28654,"for example , part of the money goes directly into improving scientific knowledge of the resources ."
28655,"from now on , stocks will be subject to regular scientific monitoring and it is stipulated that"
28656,it is therefore not the case that we simply continue to fish the maximum quantity regardless
28657,that is the reality .
28658,"secondly , we have the fishing rights based on the available data provided by Mauritania ."
28659,"on the basis of the data we have received , it has been possible to agree at this stage"
28660,"since my colleague Chris Patten has two summits at once today , I would"
28661,"secondly , we call on you to set up a conference based on the methodology and model"
28662,"we call on you to open the debate soon and we also call on you , Mr President-"
28663,the European Central Bank is in a different situation than the US Federal Reserve .
28664,"it has not only one president , one finance minister and one public as its partners , it has"
28665,"the European Parliament , as the place of the European public , wants to be a real partner"
28666,this approach of involving the national parliaments as early as possible therefore makes a second
28667,the decrease in the quantities made available to the Belgian association of so-
28668,the use of pleasure boats - and I would like to disagree with the rapporteur
28669,"certainly , the exhaust emissions are very low in comparison with the total ex"
28670,we have achieved a great deal of improvement in recent years in the case of passenger
28671,"as for the Venice Commission , my assessment is different from theirs ."
28672,"according to the Venice Commission , the implementation of the Hungarian status law will determine whether it"
28673,that is why we have been in talks with the Hungarian government and the neighbouring
28674,"the Hungarian Government is , thankfully , making efforts to do so , and the Romanian and Slovak"
28675,cable cars are subject to highly specialized ongoing innovations .
28676,"cable cars are an important economic factor in many Member States , especially in the Alpine regions ."
28677,"I am pleased that , in my first speech in the plenary of this House , I"
28678,you said that the White Paper opens the way for an interinstitutional debate .
28679,"yes , it does ."
28680,"but I would ask you , Mr Prodi , to make it clear that you do not want"
28681,no piece of legislation can be adopted without the accompaniment of this European Parliament
28682,there can be no voluntary self-agreements and there can be no framework agreement
28683,"there has also been no concrete perspective for the second challenge , the creation of a social dimension"
28684,I think that all this has serious consequences for internal acceptance in the EU and also for
28685,"there are still a few months to go , but the pace and the seriousness and depth"
28686,none of us wants to see nothing done for the protection of the environment .
28687,"but it is not acceptable , Mr President , Commissioner , that regions should suffer because Member States"
28688,this must be monitored closely here too !
28689,but I would like to say a few words about the substance of what we have seen around
28690,Mr Cornillet 's report has raised the issue of the situation in prisons in
28691,I just wanted to remind us all very briefly that we are very often abroad and
28692,the situation in prisons in the candidate countries is unacceptable to us .
28693,"however , if you read Mr Cornillet 's report , you will see that we have"
28694,"our farmers are not only our food producers , they also maintain our landscape ."
28695,"if they close their businesses because their work is no longer worthwhile , our landscape will also"
28696,the consequences affect us all .
28697,we must therefore oppose any kind of budgetary reduction at the expense of agricul

28699,my particular focus here is on the safety of existing reactors in Europe and in the candidate

28702,"for this reason , the Freedom delegation voted in favour of this report and , in"
28703,"as I said at the beginning , the European Parliament expects to be fully involved in the discussion"
28704,we are increasingly seeing European social policy as a dialogue between Council subcommittees –
28705,the European Parliament is often left out .
28706,we are opposed to this .
28707,the European Parliament must have the opportunity to play an appropriate role in shaping proposals
28708,"to this end , we need to be kept informed by the competent bodies and the"
28709,we expect a clear commitment to this from the Laeken Summit .
28710,"after all , we are the representatives of the people and therefore , in essence ,"
28711,"Mr Deprez , I have answered your question and I repeat what I said ."
28712,every word is important now .
28713,the current situation in Cyprus does not change the enlargement timetable .
28714,that means that the decisions on accessions will be taken in Copenhagen at the end of
28715,since I can firmly assume that the negotiations with Cyprus will be completed by then
28716,"given that some of the programmes will continue until 2006 , no further"
28717,I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the cultivation of nuts has now become

28719,"we have , however , found that the programmes submitted to us by the Member States ,"
28720,I will now use the second minute to address Slovenia .
28721,I am pleased that the report is so positive and that Slovenia – and as head of the
28722,there is certainly still a lot to do and there are still some questions to be answered
28723,"the Copenhagen criteria are not a static thing that you achieve once and then keep , but"
28724,we in the European Union also regularly check whether human rights are properly respected everywhere
28725,"in this sense , it is a development process that we are following closely , but we hope"
28726,"Mr President of the Commission , I am in favour of the creation of a European de"

28740,this point has not yet been satisfactorily clarified .
28741,"in its report on the implementation of the 1998 budget , the European Court"
28742,the number of errors made in the implementation of the budget is too high .
28743,"this position of the Court of Auditors and Parliament is fully shared by the Commission and , in"

28759,"in the political debate , however , there is a mood against this directive ."

28762,I regret this decision and the fact that in this House interior ministers seem to have more to

28764,it states that the regulation does not apply to passengers travelling at a reduced fare which
28765,we are afraid that this wording is a very grey wording .
28766,we should be absolutely clear that even a passenger flying at a reduced fare is
28767,I think it is very important that you see this in this way .
28768,… and I hope that you will do everything possible to make it clear during your Presidency that

28770,two final comments on the Sterckx report : I think this report on safety standards is

28774,"what I wish and what we wish is that you optimize Schengen as a security instrument , that"
28775,but there are still developments that give us cause for great concern .
28776,the ASEAN delegation attended the AIPO General Assembly in Hanoi last year and was actually
28777,"but as we were denied contact with religious leaders , we were forced to cancel this"
28778,that is exactly the point we want to point out .
28779,"there are concerning restrictions on human rights , especially religious freedom ."
28780,the question of religious freedom has nothing to do with the question of how Vietnam is organising its
28781,it is absurd to want to declare the exercise of religious freedom a threat to national security
28782,we all know that a committee of inquiry was set up in the Spanish Parliament which also investiga
28783,the European Union has entrusted the Anti-Fraud Office – OLAF – with the
28784,these investigations are still ongoing and are being closely followed by OLAF .
28785,"in this connection , I would like to raise a second point which I believe is very important"
28786,"whenever the European Parliament discusses these and other issues , it becomes clear to me that"
28787,it will be accepted if we create a common European transport policy .
28788,"it will be accepted if we create a common European environmental policy , and that is precisely where"
28789,"after all , what good are national regulations – for example for dangerous goods on the"

28791,"we do not need to explain to the citizens that we need a common European environmental policy , a"

28793,this also applies to other areas of transport policy .
28794,"that is why the Committee on Industry believes that when evaluating the measures , it is"
28795,the point is therefore not to plan any measures that cost a lot of money and that

28800,I must draw your attention to the fact that what the Member States have committed themselves to is
28801,"we do not have any legal instrument to actually demand these contributions , but we can only work"
28802,"as far as OTC derivatives are concerned , however , I do not believe that the"
28803,"why do we not follow the minimum protection of the Securities Markets Directive , for"
28804,I think it is urgently necessary to send a clear signal to public opinion that we are

28806,"to do this , a wide range of measures is necessary ."
28807,"Madam President , unfortunately I am not as good at French as you are ."
28808,"but I would be glad if Mr Bolkestein would listen for a moment , which I believe"
28809,could you please point out to him that I have something else to say to him ?
28810,"Mr Bolkestein , I have something to say to you !"
28811,the Commission must therefore be made responsible for the strategic framework for promoting employability
28812,only then can the desired multiplier effect be achieved .
28813,comprehensive information and transparency are necessary to gain public confidence and approval for
28814,we expressly welcome the consultation with trade unions and non-governmental organisations
28815,"trust is also necessary because the further development of the European model depends , among other things"

28819,"against the background of the debate in the European Convention , the various initiatives of individual governments"

28821,"I also support what the rapporteur , Mr von Boetticher , is calling for , na"
28822,I think that this is a matter of course if we take the Convention and its work seriously
28823,"Mr President , I am raising a point of order ."
28824,"I think we should ask the Commissioners to make a statement after the debate , not in the"
28825,now it is the turn of the MEPs !
28826,I think it is necessary that today at the OSCE meeting - at the same time this

28829,"nevertheless , it is necessary to continue researching a suitable and durable marker vaccine"
28830,"by the way , until 1990 in Germany only cattle were vaccinated ,"
28831,the design even supports germline therapy .
28832,this would mean that the European Parliament would be manoeuvring itself into political and scientific isolation
28833,"I am very grateful for your question , Mr Silva Roca ,"
28834,I would therefore also like to appeal to you to help us ensure that the funds allocated
28835,it would be a little late if we were to inform people in the Member States about enlargement
28836,"in my view and in the view of this House , the financing of new products is about"
28837,"there are many good reasons for this , and this actually also contains the potential for innovation and"

28839,that is precisely why we are proposing individual responsibility here .

28856,I really find this proposal so sensible that I regret not having come up with it myself .
28857,but this also shows how important it is for the Commission and Parliament to complement each other constructivel
28858,I would therefore like to thank you for your suggestions and advice .
28859,"however , I am not particularly happy with all the recommendations contained in this report ."
28860,I believe that the recommendation to Member States to artificially increase the prices of tobacco products

28862,"however , I have not yet heard that this would reduce tobacco consumption on the island much more"
28863,"the only ones who could be pleased would be our finance and budget ministers , especially"
28864,I don ’ t want to be too critical .
28865,"it is a proposal that also makes the Commission an ally of Parliament , but I would have"
28866,"dear Mr President , thank you very much for your work !"
28867,we have made progress .
28868,"thank you also for the letter you sent to the Members of this House , which clarified"
28869,I have not forgotten how you supported me in the Conference of Presidents in
28870,at that time you were the leader of the Liberal Group .
28871,it 's been a long time !
28872,the years 1996 to 1998 are currently being examined .
28873,the examination is not yet complete .
28874,then we will see what amounts can be paid out in the final analysis .

28880,"for weeks now , agricultural policy has been at the centre of public debate ."
28881,"this is a challenge and an opportunity for agricultural policy , because it is becoming clear"
28882,is it all about quantity or is it also about quality ?
28883,how strongly should we also pursue the objectives we set for the agricultura
28884,it is also very important that we do not stop at the external borders of the European Union

28895,I find it particularly interesting that we are trying to define a space that is currently composed

28897,I think that is something very interesting that you are doing here .

28927,very often more than men .
28928,this review can therefore do nothing but invite us to link the procedures even more closely

28984,now to the amendment that has been tabled .
28985,I am sorry to have to reject this amendment .
28986,why ?
28987,last year we carried out a series of trial fishing with semi-pelagic traw
28988,these experiments have clearly shown that during this period the risk for cod is very high

28994,let me conclude by making it clear once again that we can all set a signal tomorrow
28995,"if we adopt the recommendation of the Committee on Transport and Tourism by a large majority , we"
28996,"we want to shift more goods from the road to the rail , and that is why"
28997,"we will only achieve this , however , if we as Parliament take a clear position ."
28998,"we have , of course , also spoken with our legal service , and the text that I"
28999,the legal text is thus confirmed .

29002,then we have the simplified procedure .

29005,"we can only do this work , however , because we are accompanied and supported"

29034,we in the European Parliament cannot accept that the Council is trying to deny such an urgent issue
29035,these are things that we should definitely demand .
29036,a strategy for strengthening capacity must take this aspect into account .
29037,"but such a strategy is almost completely lacking , especially for Africa , where the need is great"
29038,"the Commission has a debt of service to the ACP countries in particular , and I would"

29042,these safety measures should also be taken immediately .
29043,we don ’ t need studies .
29044,we have more capacity to act .
29045,we have clarity between the institutions .
29046,we have found a balance - despite the President of the European Council - which seems to me
29047,"that is why we should vote in favour of the draft Constitution and , if possible ,"
29048,"in particular , we should also see that we need to improve in the field of foreign policy in"

29051,"in our view , this conflict is being exacerbated by the Council 's policy"

29056,"here , too , I would once again ask the minister responsible to examine whether we can agree"
29057,I cannot imagine that the Council could not accept this as well .
29058,our conclusion is first :
29059,"if national positions on a foreign policy issue are to be decided , or if two or three"
29060,"we must act together , and Europe , the European Union , must not be divided into two"
29061,you yourself said that this is your first time here .
29062,we very much welcome the fact that you will be giving account of the decisions taken under

29068,"under the current approach , manufacturers of plant protection products are obliged to ensure that their products meet"

29074,I hope that this commitment will be honoured when the case arises and the situation

29078,I would remind you that in October 2000 the Commission presented a report

29081,"at the same time , the Commission urges those responsible for organising the hunger strike"
29082,those who claim to represent the interests of those in prison should first prove this by no

29098,"in the Commission 's view , this proposal lacks the necessary political proportions , given"
29099,"in some areas , the regulatory fantasy is almost inexhaustible ."
29100,"however , the real political will is lacking in the case of truly sensitive legal issues"
29101,that is not the way to bring the citizens closer to Europe !
29102,"unfortunately , Russia is accepting this today verbally , but not in action ."
29103,that is why I think it is important that there is this joint delegation of parliamentarians

29119,which bars and restaurants in the Parliament serve fair trade coffee ?

29136,"however , the Commission is already making relevant data available in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement"
29137,the Commission therefore considers the proposal unnecessary .
29138,what are the core issues ?
29139,the core problem is not the question of the ban on money laundering .
29140,that has long been decided .
29141,"for many , many years , all Member States have had laws prohibiting money laundering ,"
29142,"that is why , Commissioner , I am returning to the discussion of a few minutes ago ."
29143,"I believe that we need more delegations , especially in Asia ."

29173,we must raise this issue in public and raise awareness among the population both in the
29174,"firstly , the lack of awareness among the population that the workers in the music industry"
29175,"all employees are involved , except the seafarers ."
29176,this is now being corrected .
29177,"after that , after Copenhagen - as has already been discussed here this morning - it will be"
29178,"I do not need to say much about this here , except that the Commission will of course be"
29179,"whatever committee or body requests technical information and needs discussion , we will be available ."
29180,"that is also our number one priority for the beginning of next year , which President Prodi"
29181,"I think that Parliament and the Commission can jointly overcome this very , very difficult task ."
29182,"according to Parliament 's proposal , the 2003 budget would amount to 1"
29183,I mention this because the debates with a view to the Brussels summit are still very
29184,but according to the proposal on the table for financing enlargement in 2004
29185,"just a brief comment on the Olsson report : Mr Olsson , I welcome and I think"
29186,we should encourage and demand this .
29187,the Commission has now created a legal basis in this proposal for a regulation .
29188,"in drawing up the proposal , the Commission was concerned to ensure that the primary responsibility"
29189,Community action is therefore limited to measures that complement the efforts of the Member States and other
29190,the report before us today does not want to know much about this .
29191,"the claim to drug policy is humanistic , for example , in that drugs should be assessed"
29192,"but drug policy has nothing to do with humanism , but much to do with the regulation of"
29193,"this means , however , that the Commission must urgently develop innovative methods of disposal and"
29194,"at the very least , it must be made clear that slaughter offal that is not process"
29195,"you speak of a new balance , a new partnership , but you do not say a word about"
29196,work on the BAT document began with an opening meeting at the European IPPC Office in late
29197,"however , experience has shown that it takes an average of two years to prepare such detailed"
29198,"finally , the report calls on the Commission to intensify dialogue with the European mining industry ."
29199,this dialogue is already taking place .
29200,it will play a central role in the implementation of the Community strategy on mining safety .
29201,I would also like to say quite frankly to our American friends - and we in the Group
29202,but that is why we also say that we will not be open to pressure from the United States
29203,we now had the Convention on Fundamental Rights .
29204,"our group would like to thank Roman Herzog and , on behalf of our Parliament , I"
29205,"it is a great job that has been done there , and of course we must ensure that this"
29206,"Mr President-in-Office , you are right ."
29207,"we must not jeopardize the work , so we need a little patience ."
29208,but I expect and hope that you will find a framework for these fundamental rights to gradually
29209,another important point concerns the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in London .
29210,"it absolutely needs an increase in the budget , because we ourselves have given it a"
29211,"this agency is to promote the development of medicines for rare diseases , the so-ca"
29212,it has already been reported today .
29213,"we have therefore initiated legislation on this matter , which entered into force only"
29214,it is only logical that we should now ensure that our decisions can be implemented in
29215,"on the other hand , it should not be in our interest to support agencies whose work"
29216,we believe that this is the case with the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen .
29217,the Committee on Budgets has also recognised this .
29218,"it is not a question of regularly increasing the funding for any agencies , but of"
29219,"that is what I ask you to do , and I ask you to vote in this spirit ."
29220,"firstly , the issue of conflict prevention ."
29221,we can see in Macedonia a case of failed conflict prevention .
29222,if all Council members had been as active as the Members of this Parliament have been for years
29223,"if this had been a part of the Stabilisation and Association Agreements , if it had been"
29224,"the Macedonians would not have to change their constitution today under time pressure , as if as a"
29225,so much for the missed conflict prevention in this country !
29226,"since the integration of environmental aspects is a long-term commitment , I am in principle"
29227,the arguments that too long negotiations with the Council would jeopardise existing and
29228,"I also believe that Amendment No 9 , which aims to involve civil society in the"
29229,"Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate the people of East Timor on"
29230,"I am particularly honoured to speak about East Timor today , because I was there from"
29231,"Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , I am not sure what the Commission"
29232,I would also like to thank the rapporteurs very warmly for their work .
29233,"as Mrs Lagendijk has already said , the situation in the Balkans today is quite different"
29234,"but that must not lead us to say that everything has gone well , that the matter is over"
29235,I also think that the Commission 's proposed step is right and justified .
29236,"however , Commissioner , we have already discussed this , and if this is really the case -"
29237,it is certainly also due to the structure of the decision-making processes .
29238,"in this sense , you will certainly not be able to give us an answer today ."
29239,Parliament 's delegation to the Conciliation Committee was concerned about the continuation of
29240,"that is why we have finally approved the compromise , even though we were not fully satisf"
29241,we have accepted that the appropriations are to be increased to EUR 77 million .
29242,"this is an acceptable result , although not fully satisfactory ."
29243,we have chosen this compromise in order not to jeopardise the continuation of the
29244,"however , without increased efforts by the Member States , it does not appear possible to achieve the object"
29245,"on this basis , we will have broader , more objective criteria for assessing the"
29246,"all in all , there is still considerable need for clarification and improvement in the proposal ."
29247,I am waiting for the Commission to provide information on the issues raised in order to be able
29248,what are the challenges for the coming year that we have to consider in the case of small household
29249,"firstly , and this applies to all households : budgetary prudence ."
29250,when I see that we in the European Parliament alone are planning an increase of 0 .
29251,"with a total budget of EUR 965 million , we are not taking a too big"
29252,"Commissioner , I would like to say , particularly with regard to the dangerous nuclear power"
29253,"it must be possible to say that we are demanding British , French and German standards ."
29254,"if that is not possible , then I wonder why we care about the curvature of cucumber"
29255,we want to help Mauritius and Guinea develop fisheries management and provide financial support for training and
29256,"for Mauritius , for example , almost 50 % of the total financial volume is now to"
29257,I personally think it is a good thing that development measures are also promoted in connection
29258,the fisheries sector is a perfect example of such a combination .
29259,"however , in the Committee on Fisheries we are increasingly being confronted with the question of"
29260,there is a danger that the European Union will one day be laughed at and exploi
29261,"Furthermore , to what extent are third countries really all dependent on EU funds today ?"
29262,bilateral agreements are increasingly coming into force because shipowners or others offer more money than
29263,"if the latter were to be the norm and regulated by the market itself , one should"
29264,this would of course have to be compatible with the common European fisheries policy .
29265,"I do not know why we should not succeed here , as we have succeeded with all"
29266,I therefore do not share the concern expressed here in any way .
29267,we are in a completely normal procedure .
29268,we should have a successful second reading and then we should seek a good compromise in the
29269,Commissioner Verheugen has understandable complexions when he imposes 6 000
29270,we should rather ask ourselves what we are expecting from the citizens of the future Union
29271,"parliaments , national ones like ours , are called upon to put their finger on the"
29272,"in assessing this lack of fairness , I refer , for Austria , to the decision"
29273,"I regret the way the committee has acted , because I believe that in such a sensitive"
29274,"Mr President-in-Office , allow me to make one final comment on the Pack report which"
29275,the European Parliament has no institutional ideas on this .
29276,"it simply wants to take an efficient position , and there is a broad agreement on"
29277,"in this respect , and taking into account the European Council 's decision on the Agency 's"
29278,the advisory role of the Board of Directors in deciding on individual reconstruction projects
29279,"in this context , there is certainly broad agreement that a reasonable division of labour between Pris"
29280,it would be helpful if you could take a position on this which would make it easi
29281,… and that is why the Commission has decided to take this step .
29282,"finally , since this is the last time that the Commission will be able to present such com"
29283,"Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mrs Dührkop"
29284,it may be surprising that a fifth supplementary and amending budget is being tabled
29285,"I would like to remind you , however , that in recent years Parliament and the Union as"
29286,"and behold , the number is increasing ."
29287,"I do , however , think that we have created greater openness and also greater verifi"
29288,"however , the amounts of course amount to millions ."
29289,the figures thus document how urgently necessary a functioning control system is .
29290,"as the rapporteur for fraud in this House , I would like to draw your attention to a"
29291,"all Member States report to the Commission the irregularities that occur , but only a few Member States"
29292,we have also looked at the level of debt .
29293,"we believe that market abuse is a crime very similar to other crimes against property , such"
29294,there is no such thing as negligent fraud or negligent theft .
29295,"such a thing can only be committed intentionally , i.e. voluntarily ."
29296,that is why one of the wishes of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market
29297,"I do not know how the vote will end , but I believe it is important that we get"
29298,we have contributed to the fact that today there is a race between ever more powerful vessels
29299,"we have reinforced this trend by using the financial resources primarily to buy new , more"
29300,"finally , we have also sown a climate of distrust through completely different controls and"
29301,the greatest obstacle on the way to European democracy - and this must be said once and
29302,the Council failed in Nice in its task of giving Europe a constitution .
29303,this was the arrogance of power that jeopardises the acceptance of European un
29304,the biggest open question in this debate about European democracy is the position of the Commission .
29305,"however , I regret that , because it is a virtual money fund , so to speak , it"
29306,"this would provide us with a more flexible instrument to help the citizens , businesses and institutions affected"
29307,this restriction would be another important step towards a coherent and uniform development of European law .
29308,this is also the direction in which the opinions of the Economic and Social Committee have been ai
29309,they mean additional complications and problems of delimitation .
29310,the proposal is not so much due to the matter itself as to the constraints of seeking

29312,ecology and ethics are increasingly playing a role in the production of food .
29313,they must be precisely clarified in the course of the implementation of the tasks of
29314,"Mr President , I would like to briefly inform the House , and I believe the Presidency"
29315,the lawyers – and I would like to mention this in this context – Michael Hausfeld and
29316,I think that is worth telling the House .
29317,"Mr President , I am delighted that this House has adopted , by a majority of"
29318,the House has done so in a form that enables the Czech Republic to break away from these
29319,"I appeal to Prague to take up this sign , this call , this request for dialogue ,"
29320,"let me conclude by expressing our deep regret , also on behalf of the Commission ,"
29321,"it is a pity that some of the previous speakers are no longer here , because they"
29322,but maybe you can tell them then .
29323,"fourthly , there are regional problems to be solved : the improvement of relations with Greece"
29324,I would like to return to this question again :
29325,Turkey must know that we demand of every candidate country that it be absolutely willing to have good
29326,"as part of the preparation for negotiations with Turkey , it is important that it regula"
29327,a difficult question .
29328,"all parties and all those concerned must do their part to resolve the Cyprus issue , including ,"
29329,"unfortunately , the Heads of State or Government did not take up this Commission proposal at"
29330,but the issue is far too important to be left in the drawer .
29331,I therefore immediately decided to draw up a Green Paper to clarify the proposal for
29332,the time until the next reform of the Treaties should therefore be used to the fullest
29333,"as well as working well with Mrs Palacio , we will also work well with the Commissioner-design"
29334,"Mr Barnier is well placed to understand , apply and implement regional policy , thanks to his"
29335,"he said something that convinced me very much , namely : ‘ Yes , we respect the"
29336,"in this respect , we are also looking forward to working with you , Mr Barnier ."
29337,"Mr President , at the end of this debate , I am pleased to see that there is"
29338,let me briefly turn to the main issues of the debate .
29339,I would like to point out a second aspect .
29340,this programme provides for private public partnership to an unprecedented extent .
29341,"in the area of culture in particular , we urgently need to find new forms of private"
29342,I would therefore strongly urge Parliament and its various committees - the Committee on Industry
29343,a lot has already been said about OLAF by previous speakers .
29344,"the most recent , really serious statement by the monitoring committee on recruitment has also been quote"
29345,"in the so-called area of freedom , security and justice , the Deprez report aims"
29346,"in the discussion of the proposal , the rapporteur repeatedly denied that this would"
29347,"I therefore believe that the Commission would have been well advised to follow our idea , the"
29348,"Furthermore , I would like to point out that the Commission believes that each of the"
29349,the example you have given of the UK in relation to the medical professions is actually proof
29350,I believe I have already explained in detail in my introductory remarks that consumer protection

29352,"we do not have a common assessment of demographic developments , nor do we know what"
29353,"unfortunately , the lack of a global strategy and the lack of statistical basis"
29354,the Commission is confusing economic immigration with asylum .
29355,I believe that family reunification for asylum seekers and refugees needs to be regula
29356,someone who is expelled from his home country must be subject to different rules than someone
29357,"I hope that the Commission and Parliament can remain tough on the Council , which is taking a"
29358,I also believe that money should be used for more information activities to provide more objective information on

29363,"for my group , it is not an outmoded concept to want more individuality , more"
29364,we will succeed if people have an adequate social safety net available throughout Europe .
29365,this network must - and this is my group 's firm conviction - also include the
29366,the reports of the last few days are alarming .
29367,"at the beginning of December , two Tibetans were sentenced to death by the Kardze People"

29369,the question is clearly whether the highly sensitive safety issues of air traffic management are not better

29372,"in Chapter I , the Court reiterates its request to the Commission from the previous year for"
29373,"the Commission 's answer to this may be technically correct , but it is not politically"
29374,there is still a lot to be done here .
29375,"the Court 's statements in Chapter 9 of the DAS are very interesting , but"
29376,"the testament is not given , with the exception of a few areas ."
29377,it is a question of whether the top mark of this bar will ever be reached .
29378,"a number of points will be particularly important for discharge , such as the reforms of"
29379,our farmers certainly do not want this policy !
29380,should consumers continue to support this practice by eating meat ?
29381,"he simply will not do this for ethical , moral and emotional reasons ."
29382,the renunciation of animal meal feed benefits the producer and the consumer .
29383,the voluntary renunciation of this is already very positively felt in the meat advertising
29384,"as regards the outcome of parliamentary work , let me first say that many of the"
29385,the main improvements are the following : the establishment of a monitoring and information centre as

29388,"as regards genetically modified material , I believe that this report provides legal protection by referring"
29389,all the upcoming changes will and must apply here .
29390,"Furthermore , Mrs Klaß , it would be important for us to emphasise the"
29391,"I hope that the winegrowers will stay away from this in their own interest , because we"
29392,I hope that this will prevent us from opening the wine to this material .
29393,"Mr President , hardly a day passes without the media reporting on acts of violence"
29394,"citizens ’ initiatives , religious communities and other social groups have been warning against right-"
29395,"it exists in the East and West , even if it is initiated by a minorit"

29399,"however , I also believe , Mr Barón Crespo , that this is not a topic for"
29400,you also know that it was not essentially my party-political friends who contributed to
29401,"I would ask you to express the criticism you express in other cases to your own party ,"
29402,their credibility would be greater if they applied the same standards to all sides
29403,"in Lisbon , the great opportunity to make a real substantial difference for the citizens of Europe was"
29404,"instead , wishful thinking has been formulated , which can never be checked and which"
29405,people will end up saying goodbye to such a Europe .
29406,we cannot allow this to happen .
29407,"I am , of course , pleased that the President-in-Office is here today ."
29408,"as far as the Commission is concerned , we are always pleased to have it here ."
29409,"Madam President-in-Office , we recognise that ."
29410,we have also said something critical in the past .
29411,I hope that your positive example of being here today will also be an example for future presidencies
29412,we expect that the Council of Ministers ' presence here in the European Parliament will be significant
29413,I also welcome the clear position taken by the Commission on this matter .
29414,"we are not always on the same side , but in this case , Mr President of the Commission"
29415,"I am pleased that you are one of those few allies , as is the Presidency"
29416,the most important and tangible result so far is the fact that a discussion and a certain political
29417,this must be acknowledged and actively supported .
29418,"however , this is not only about meeting the Copenhagen criteria , but also about democratic standard"
29419,"Turkey 's membership on such a basis , and not only for geostrategic considerations"
29420,"Mr President , the evaluation of a far-reaching and not always concretely formulated"
29421,what the rapporteur has made of it makes the matter even more difficult .
29422,I think that what the Commission has presented to us was a very good starting point .
29423,"I actually regret the Commission officials , who have produced a very good report , that their good work"
29424,I cannot congratulate the rapporteur .
29425,I have asked for the floor because the experience of recent days and weeks has also shown how

29427,"if a referendum , then a European referendum with a European result , namely a double majority of"
29428,the Commission will use 2001 to carry out in-depth analyses
29429,we must take this time so as not to fall victim to hasty political action .
29430,the seven-point plan is not a mouth-watering deal for European farmers
29431,"it is the only chance to mitigate the income losses of farmers , at least in"
29432,"unfortunately , the Commission is not in a position , with its financial resources , to fully"
29433,"Unselling beef , consumer distrust and skyrocketing costs are a highly explosive"
29434,our seven-point plan is designed to make it possible to remove the detonator from this
29435,but our plan is also to ensure that beef is safer than ever for the consumer and
29436,I am very grateful for this initiative .
29437,"I believe that this is the real task of this House , not just to condemn at all times"
29438,I would just like to return to one point which I myself tabled as an amendment
29439,"it must be possible to work with the resources , networks and information banks that are available"
29440,we do not need to constantly reinvent the wheel .
29441,"we should use what we have , compare the findings and then work with them ."
29442,my last point is the :
29443,several speakers have complained about a lack of conceptual clarity and co
29444,I am a little surprised about it .
29445,I think the term is quite clear .
29446,"we want to have a policy that addresses those who , after enlargement , will be our"
29447,"these are the countries , as Romano Prodi quite rightly said , from Russia to Morocco ."
29448,"of course , it is an easy thing , and I could produce it for you , if you"
29449,that does not change the fact that we would have to use different instruments for the countries of the
29450,"Mr Brok ’ s attempt is honorable , and I do not blame him for it"
29451,Mr Brok will certainly agree with me when I say that to include an alternative to Turkey
29452,"you can demand that , Mr Silva , but the Commission cannot ."
29453,"for this reason , for principle reasons , the EU is against the death penalty and makes it"
29454,"however , we must also make it a criterion by which to measure our partners ."
29455,"we therefore call on the Philippines , quite clearly , to a ) respect the moratorium"
29456,the challenge of the future will be whether the EU will succeed in developing common principles

29462,"the prerequisites for this are not primarily state capital , but human capital , not"
29463,"the training available differs from one country to another , and accordingly we have stipulated"
29464,the goal is that the training is equal .
29465,"if a country already offers training , this directive is not intended to change it ."
29466,"this includes , for example , the federal state system in the Federal Republic of Germany with the original"
29467,these must also be accepted by the Commission .
29468,it is hard to imagine that we can change the Treaty without the consent of the Länder
29469,"therefore , Mr President , you should become the advocate of the rights of the Member States"
29470,that is why we are calling for a catalogue of competences that clearly distinguishes

29478,"I believe that this should be rethought in future , because financial resources alone are not"
29479,the Commission has also been very sparing with this money .
29480,payments amounted to only 50 % of the commitments .
29481,so a lot has been achieved with relatively little resources .
29482,this is particularly commendable .
29483,perhaps it would be possible in future to save a little more on administrative expenditure .
29484,there is certainly still potential here .
29485,"on the other hand , we should be very keen to improve and expand this programme in the future"
29486,"the committee responsible has made proposals in this regard , and the European Parliament would be proud"
29487,"in the field of information technology , the information society , in particular , we will not be able"
29488,"I believe that investing in these areas , or in biotechnology , where we still have to"
29489,see also explanation of vote on accession treaties .

29496,"we of course reject both forms of torture in equal measure , and it is"

29525,both have indicated that special decisions on Turkey are to be expected in Copenhagen .
29526,I think that we should be careful in our reactions to the new government .
29527,"we are not talking about suspicion , nor about laurels or a persil certificate"
29528,this government must first show that it is capable of implementing the decisions of the last parliament
29529,we must and can only make promises to Turkey that we are prepared to honour in

29547,if we expect the citizen with a car to be healthy and to meet the proper personal

29577,I also think that 2004 is completely inappropriate .
29578,we are in a position to complete this by the end of 2003 .
29579,a new Treaty of Rome would then perhaps also be the right basis for the European elections

29626,we hope that in the coming weeks we will develop a joint strategy to work against this .
29627,the Member States have signalled that they will not amend the Treaty in this area .
29628,"the Commission is not yet abandoning this field , however , but is continuing to clarify"
29629,Mr Jarzembowski has already pointed out that :
29630,it is difficult to balance the need for maximum safety with the need to manage costs .

29659,"formally , in 1994 , we introduced a uniform definition of tonnage"
29660,"under this regulation , Member States had to submit tonnage estimates by 1995"
29661,let me make a remark which is only indirectly related to this question .
29662,there are considerations about the Stability Pact .
29663,"the Stability Pact must not be called into question , even in such a catastroph"
29664,"I therefore recommend that we – the Commission , the Council and Parliament – should not shake"
29665,then this European Union will be accepted by the people much more than we often assume .
29666,competition policy is therefore rightly one of the most important policies .
29667,"we can be proud of a European culture of competition , which will actually make the social market economy"
29668,we can be proud of our antitrust and merger control .
29669,"we must , however , be vigilant in the face of global actors , for whom national"
29670,"we must therefore remember a quote by the French writer Vivienne Forestier , who describes"
29671,society is abandoning itself to the market .
29672,that is not what we want in the European Union .
29673,we know that in the age of alliances and millennium mergers - USD 2
29674,"more than ever before , relations with China are of politically strategic importance ."
29675,"a one-dimensional development , as it is currently taking place on China ’ s doorstep with"

29678,I believe that it is important to organise administration well .

29685,energyland should actually be Europe .

29687,"we should , of course , focus more on energy and energy infrastructure in the future , because energy"
29688,I therefore conclude by saying that the euro – and the report shows this – is a

29690,I believe that the legislative authority 's intention for this wording was clear .
29691,"if the discharge decision is exceptionally postponed , the Commission should respond very quickly in"
29692,"now the proposals here suggest October , which is six months later ."
29693,this is not necessarily a quick response in the sense of Article 146 .
29694,there are three other problems with this postponement procedure .
29695,"firstly , the Commission must ensure that Parliament considers the reasons for postponing the"
29696,"secondly , if action is planned , six months is again relatively short ."
29697,"if answers and commitments are provided for , then the Commission can or should also present them"
29698,"thirdly , if these conditions are provided for in the Rules of Procedure themselves as"
29699,the President-in-Office of the Council was right to refer to Chechnya .
29700,"the European Parliament , at least our group , but I think others too , will be watching"

29707,"the new Director , Mr Brüner , has now been in office for more than a year"
29708,the question of the independence of the Office and of the Director is of course on the table
29709,the Commission 's position on this point is contradictory .
29710,"when it comes to the recruitment of new managers , the Commission wants to monitor"
29711,"however , when it comes to taking back staff who do not meet the new requirements of the Office"
29712,it was the Commission which simply transferred all the staff of the former UCLAF task force
29713,if we want to rethink our overall role as a Commission in terms of control activities inside
29714,this means that we will have plenty of opportunities to discuss these issues in depth next year .
29715,that is the core of the report .
29716,I know that the Czech Republic is not yet a member of the European Union .
29717,"I would , however , be interested to hear the Commission 's opinion on this article and whether"
29718,"it would be interesting , as Gordon Adam also asked , how she assesses the environmental impact a"

29734,"I would also like to thank , on behalf of the Commission , those from the other committee"
29735,the common position is also a great success .
29736,"in its common position , the Council has followed almost 70 % of the content of Parliament"
29737,"it is gratifying to note , especially as rapporteur on genetically modified food and feed ,"
29738,I hope that tomorrow 's vote will be a very important step towards the ratification of

29745,an increase in the Community funding for energy networks in the 2002-

29747,there have obviously been specific interests at play so far .
29748,the Commission even claimed in a trialogue that the European insurers were against my

29750,they are in favour of this solution .
29751,"that is why I recommend , Commissioner , that the Commission urgently reconsider its position ."
29752,it is unsustainable .
29753,I assume that the Council will then also accept this solution .
29754,"Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to thank the rapporteur in advance for his work and"
29755,"it is of great importance for the European financial market , for the internal market , for financial services"
29756,"we must , in particular , be careful that cases of the size of Enron or World"
29757,it is an essential contribution to the stability of the financial markets in Europe .
29758,it is in the financial institutions ’ own interest that such a regulation is made .
29759,it is also necessary that Parliament be fully informed and involved .
29760,"this is particularly necessary because a great many issues , especially the new ones – many"

29772,"the Swoboda report goes far beyond the Commission proposal on one point , by demanding that"
29773,this would have two consequences .
29774,"firstly , the financial instruments ISPA and SAPARD should be reduced and , secondly"
29775,both are hard to imagine .
29776,I can agree with the Swoboda report on the other budgetary technical points .
29777,I too am concerned that Turkey should not be discriminated against .
29778,"however , SAPARD and ISPA are instruments tailored to transforming societies , which"
29779,this is not the case with Turkey .
29780,"however , it is up to Turkey to make the domestic political decisions ."
29781,"I believe that we , this Parliament , should send a clear signal that we support those forces in"
29782,that is also the purpose of my report .
29783,we now needed a working hypothesis for the accessions .
29784,"without a date , we would not have been able to negotiate the financial chapter ,"
29785,the financial package for each country looks completely different depending on the date on which you are working
29786,"in this respect , the decision was necessary ."
29787,"I understand that the Council adopted it , taking into account , above all , the time required"
29788,"that should be taken into account , as I have said many times ."
29789,it is at least as important that the Council does not delay the so-called tele
29790,I also trust that he will now adopt this quickly and that we will proceed with the rest
29791,I hope that the Council will not let us down in this and that one or the other Member

29838,"( de ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to know why you are presenting us"
29839,my question is : does this have anything to do with a new strategy ?
29840,is it correct that you want to move away from product policy towards waste streams in the future
29841,I would like to mention four points that I consider to be essential .
29842,"firstly , it is unacceptable that the military continues to dominate European airspace"
29843,it is about us achieving a sensible coordination where civil and military aviation are equal
29844,I would like to ask the Presidency of the Council to pursue the Lisbon process consiste
29845,"this means that we are actually implementing an appropriate and sufficient policy mix , pur"
29846,"this also applies to financial policy , because we must make it clear , through investment policy ,"
29847,"however , Madam Vice-President , we need to introduce the rules in a more differentiated way"
29848,we should therefore be more generous in the transitional provisions so as not to put
29849,important institutional decisions have already been taken in the last ten days .
29850,the independence of the Yugoslav National Bank was secured .
29851,customs administration has finally ceased to be an instrument of corruption .
29852,it is also important that the EU lifts the trade sanctions as soon as possible .
29853,"Commissioner Patten , who is in Belgrade today , should take up the proposal of those respons"
29854,"secondly , we are right to call for the EU to accede to the ECHR ."
29855,a majority in the Convention is already outlining this position .
29856,"if Parliament wants to continue to play its role as a driving force , it must ,"
29857,"in my view , it is not sufficient to simply state in recital Z that the EC"
29858,"this statement conceals a problem , because the question of the relationship between the national constitutional court"
29859,I believe that the Constitutional Treaty must provide its own answer to this question in the report
29860,the sums invested here are of course not in any proportion to the sums invested
29861,"this is therefore a huge gap which we must fill as soon as possible , because jobs"
29862,"now that the Iron Curtain fell almost 15 years ago , it is not appropri"
29863,"in the Commission 's view , regional tensions and demands for greater autonomy or"
29864,"in addition , there are also a number of amendments which at first glance seem reason"
29865,"for this reason , we will not support these amendments ."
29866,"Mr President , Commissioner , I am very pleased that I have managed to get some of"
29867,I hope that the Commissioner is also satisfied with this .
29868,"as rapporteur , I see the establishment of this new solidarity instrument as an important"
29869,it gives the EU an unbureaucratic means of responding to disasters in the

29871,he therefore limits himself to the most urgent needs .
29872,"the long-term reconstruction of infrastructure and the economy is left to other instruments , and this"
29873,"the EUR 1 billion that this fund is supposed to receive is fictitious ,"
29874,"thirdly , we are concerned about the security of supply and we believe that great attention must"
29875,"the Treaty contains appropriate rules of transparency and clarity for this , but it"
29876,we want to make sure that this remains the case .
29877,I have nothing against European parties .
29878,I think that they are indeed facing the challenge of coordinating their work across borders
29879,"but there is one thing I do not think is acceptable , namely that European political parties"
29880,the Court of Auditors ' criticism was justified .
29881,"secondly , we want to see a review of the relationship between social measures and adjustment"
29882,social measures have been cut from EUR 31 million to EUR 29 million in
29883,this is incomprehensible to us .
29884,we believe that structural adjustment aid must be provided in this area .
29885,employment has fallen from 15 % to 5 % since 19
29886,"we do , however , believe that adjustment aid can be reduced ."
29887,the adjustment aid has not been used up in recent years .
29888,"in 1999 , for example , only half of the budgeted funds were actually"
29889,"the Commission , on the other hand , intends to cover the entire period up to June"
29890,"we find this absurd , since there will still be a functional budget in the second half of"
29891,we also want a review of administrative expenditure .
29892,Parliament has been proposing cuts for a long time .
29893,"given the reduction in ECSC activities , given the restructuring , it is question"
29894,"however , I must also make it clear that the European rules on animal transport , when properly"
29895,the fundamental problem here - and this is also emphasised by the Commission in its report -
29896,"apart from the problem of transposing the directive into national law , it is mainly"
29897,the main criticism in this area is therefore to be directed at the Member States .
29898,I believe that the Community 's control policy should be fundamentally rethinked in this respect
29899,"the fact that the debate on this report has already been placed in the right context , na"
29900,"we were in Kaliningrad recently with a delegation from our House , and anyone who walks"
29901,"we had the opportunity to talk to the mayor of Kaliningrad , who complained bitter"
29902,"in this context , it is particularly important that TB patients can be helped ."
29903,who can blame the small states and monetary skeptics if their distrust is now growing
29904,the damage to the Stability Pact : a black day for Europe .
29905,the result : a crisis of confidence and politics within the European Union .
29906,"Madam President , you are a person who has always been very much in favour of dialogue with"
29907,your policy is in contrast to what Mr Berlusconi has said .
29908,given that you have found very clear words in other situations – which have not always been
29909,that is what I would ask you to do .
29910,the health insurance discussion in the EU must not lead to a dead end .
29911,"as long as the requirements for supplementary insurance are not defined throughout Europe , we must be"
29912,the risk that not entirely healthy citizens and elderly people can only be insured private
29913,misconceptions of this kind have no place in the European Union .
29914,"in the first phase , it is therefore necessary and useful for us to draw up a"
29915,"it will then be our task to define minimum standards for supplementary insurance for Europe , provided"
29916,"I think that 's what we want , right ?"
29917,"if there are some exceptions to this , I consider that to be a positive thing ."
29918,"it is positive that there are few , but it is also positive that there are these few ."
29919,the few exceptions are for security reasons and to protect privacy .
29920,"I consider this to be important in this context , because it has succeeded in one thing ,"
29921,"if that is the case , then it is also clear that we must discuss as ideologically"
29922,if we therefore agree that we want to discuss this issue without ideologies and know that illegal
29923,"if we agree on this , then we must also admit , Mr Kirkhope , that if we"
29924,we say yes to a stronger orientation of the equity allocation of credit risks to
29925,"we say ' yes ' to taking greater account of risk-reducing techniques , and"
29926,"it was necessary to extend the Basel Committee ’ s focus to large banks , external rating"
29927,"in this context , it is also positive to note that it has been clearly accepted that intra"
29928,this is also important because a pure reduction to the external rating would have made loans for
29929,now I would like to say something about the matter itself .
29930,"we have confidence in the Commission , in Mr Prodi , and the vast majority of our"
29931,but we also believe that we must have a debate on this Commission strategy in an orderly manner
29932,there is no such document !
29933,why is the Commission not considering using the instruments available to it under the decision of the panel
29934,I believe that it is now necessary for us to make this clear to the United States .
29935,"together , we in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism have achieved that we"
29936,"we have lowered the minimum thresholds for funding the action , as the rapporteur"
29937,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the response of the House , the broad support for"
29938,I have no further explanations to add !
29939,we now know that the negotiation results were not easy to achieve .
29940,the enlargement countries have also negotiated very intensively not only on the level but also
29941,I think that this has to be respected .
29942,that is why the Commission has adopted these proposals or the results of the negotiations
29943,I think it is very important and very good that we will have the opportunity to discuss the way
29944,"I would ask you to convey this position , which is now official , to Mr Gis"
29945,there is hope that the President of the Convention will also understand that the head of the executive in
29946,I think that all of this would be a way of stopping this dangerous disease .
29947,"I strongly doubt that we can eradicate them in general , and that is the"
29948,"I therefore call for prophylaxis , which can also be called prophylaxis , and"
29949,let me make two final remarks .
29950,I have the impression that it is very dangerous to work in an institution in particular because the
29951,"we – not Parliament and not the Commission – will of course have to analyse , on the basis"
29952,I fully agree with you that it is absolutely necessary to inform the Bulgarian public precisely
29953,"we always pretend that these are obvious , and I am therefore grateful that you"
29954,the vast majority of the population in Bulgaria does not take it for granted that the country'
29955,"unfortunately , there is no possibility of doing more today , as our scope of"
29956,"the consultation procedure in force here and , above all , the restrictive framework conditions of"
29957,"I would ask you all to follow me , at least in these amendments ."
29958,"in Poland , these structures were developed in 2001 and 200"
29959,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased ."
29960,economic and social cohesion is at the heart of the European Union .
29961,"it offers the possibility of a sustainable , harmonious and at the same time polycentric"
29962,"the debate now is about the European Union of the future , about a Union of 25"
29963,the idea of integration in this Union will only remain credible if there is also a willing
29964,we must assume that the idea of Europe is accepted by its citizens regardless of their regional and
29965,"it is , however , an illusion to believe that we will have a lot more money available"
29966,that is why it is our task to develop a concept that works according to the aforemention
29967,"what is needed , however , is that the so-called non-trade concerns must"
29968,"the WTO must no longer avoid consumer protection , environmental and animal welfare standards ."
29969,"this also includes implementing the development work of the EU-15 Member States , as has"
29970,"the Commission cannot , however , accept Amendment No 3 , because it would contradict"
29971,"it goes without saying , however , that the Commission will always adhere to the guidelines set"
29972,what are these differences ?
29973,you propose to treat the protection of refugees and subsidiary protection together .
29974,we are against this ; we want separate directives .
29975,they propose that protection be extended far beyond the Geneva Convention .
29976,we want the Geneva Convention to be maintained .
29977,they want to go much further in family reunification than the consensus in the House has
29978,we want the nuclear family .
29979,they want to grant five years of subsidiary protection on residence permits .
29980,"that is not the point , but we want protection as long as it is necessary and useful"
29981,"with the measures you are proposing here , you are not providing for rapid aid"
29982,"at the same time , however , we must be aware that Nigeria is not an isolated case"
29983,"according to Amnesty International , for example , in Iran in 2001 and"
29984,I would like to highlight one point in particular .
29985,I was particularly pleased that the report did not only deal with the reform of the
29986,this has set a focus and a signal for the citizens .
29987,"other aspects , such as respect for non-discrimination and non-discrimination in"
29988,"at the same time , particular attention should be paid to the specific issue of the high proportion of"
29989,Mrs Schreyer promised the Committee on Budgetary Control these figures on 24
29990,with always new excuses .
29991,"on Tuesday , she tried to make us in this House believe , contrary to the truth"
29992,I have a great deal of understanding and even admiration for the enormous work that all
29993,I know how difficult it was to find majorities for these reports .
29994,"I therefore regret that I cannot , despite this , give my unreserved support to"
29995,the Commission should provide greater financial support for this development .
29996,"to get an idea of what is needed , we should finally implement our own decision from 2"
29997,as long as the Member States of the European Union are not prepared to increase their defence

30011,I am pleased to have the opportunity to briefly present and explain our policy to Parliament today
30012,it is also good that this law paves the way for the proper location of new production facilities
30013,we do not want to interfere in the affairs of the Member States .
30014,sport is part of the subsidiarity principle .
30015,we simply want sport to be recognised by the Commission and European law as a matter of
30016,"I agree with you that , after these achievements have been made on all sides , there"
30017,"we , as the European Parliament , are ready to do our part by adhering to the time"
30018,it was this House that decided that accession should take place so that these countries could take part
30019,"when the accession treaty , which is supposed to be about 6 00"
30020,we have indeed had a very serious and also very self-critical debate on the quality
30021,what conclusions have we drawn ?
30022,"we have found that the quality of legislation leaves much to be desired , especially in"
30023,"there is sometimes frustration , but also a lack of knowledge of European law , and we"
30024,"we will of course , when the legislative proposals for these reform ideas are on the table"

30035,in this sense - and I do not want to repeat everything Mrs Schröder has said
30036,we must act together .
30037,it is unacceptable that in the middle of Europe - and Moldova is part of this Europe
30038,this is not acceptable to us .
30039,"finally , the immense social problems , which some Members have already mentioned , especially"
30040,"this requires a joint fight against corruption , nepotism and bureaucracy , but also"
30041,"for this we also need a Mediterranean bank , which , however , for organisational reasons ,"
30042,"in addition to the sensitive political issues of human rights , I would like to mention once again"
30043,"it is important that we also discuss climate protection in this context , because the world agreed in"
30044,"therefore , there must also be opportunities to enforce climate protection measures in the WTO"
30045,the development of guidelines on the gathering and use of expertise is another important measure taken

30047,the guidelines that apply to Commission services seeking and using expert advice are precisely ai
30048,"Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to say a few words about the European Union ."
30049,I too would like to thank Mrs Corbey very much for the great effort she has put into
30050,"after all , she had to deal with 123 amendments , 3"
30051,I would also like to thank Mrs Ayuso González very warmly for having managed to bring
30052,"as far as the specific preparation is concerned , this means that we must prepare oursel"
30053,"anyone who starts looking for buildings , for example in the accession countries , only when"
30054,we must therefore make an effort in time to prepare ourselves for sound budgetary management

30071,"Madam President , I would like to take this opportunity , after you have raised this issue in"
30072,I would ask you to understand that we do not necessarily need an urgent procedure of our own
30073,Commissioners have also now publicly acknowledged that there have been major problems in this
30074,"on 15 May this year , for example , Commissioner Nielson told the Financial Times that"
30075,"it was designed to produce directives and regulations , conduct trade negotiations and facilitate"
30076,it does not work for development aid .
30077,"secondly , did I understand you correctly that you intend to refer the matter to the"
30078,will you do so immediately or do you want to inform the House beforehand ?
30079,"you yourself have said that , when you receive the file , you must first inform the plenary"

30086,the Commission intends to propose new elements for the negotiating strategy in the autumn

30088,"there are more refusals than commitments , and I think it is necessary to redefine"
30089,"the diversity of cultural heritage underlines the identity of the regions themselves , which is why"
30090,I am strongly opposed to the introduction of duties and taxes on plant protection products
30091,the increase in prices means a weakening of competitiveness rather than a real reduction in
30092,"finally , I would like to say that it is unacceptable for European agriculture if"
30093,these measures must not be limited to television but must be applied to all accessible media .
30094,the accession countries must of course be integrated into this process now .
30095,"since the media market is a matter of supply and demand , i.e. a tough"
30096,the odds alone count .
30097,protection mechanisms that are not or are difficult to circumvent must therefore be used .
30098,"secondly , the reform of employment systems ."
30099,"there are 13.6 million unemployed in the EU , a situation that cannot"
30100,"instead of managing unemployment , employability must be significantly increased through qualification measures"
30101,"simple , uniform solutions , such as a Europe-wide reduction in working hours , are not"
30102,"we need intelligent , differentiated solutions , such as making working time more flexible , tailored"
30103,I told you there are new possibilities .
30104,if it is argued that this production is absolutely necessary for the preservation of the
30105,it is precisely for this purpose that we have increased the funds for promoting environmental measures
30106,it cannot be both right .
30107,one cannot argue that it is an important production if it is obviously not important enough for
30108,either or !
30109,now to your report .
30110,"the Committee on Budgetary Control has made a number of criticisms , particularly of OL"
30111,"while I understand the rapporteur 's displeasure , I do not think the criticism"

30117,"secondly , the question of the design of the building ."
30118,"the French law is very strict in this regard , considering this building as a work of art"
30119,but we decided – intellectual property or not – to negotiate with the architects
30120,"if it is already dark in the July sun , how will it look in the pale December light"
30121,we don ’ t want to do that to ourselves or to you .
30122,"I hope that we will be able to make red pink , dark blue perhaps light blue or"
30123,"finally , we would like to make it quite clear that this Millennium Round also has a"
30124,"this is essential , because it is no longer just about reducing tariffs and quotas ,"
30125,we should also make this clear to the non-governmental organisations .
30126,the place for the political debate on the Millennium Round in Europe is the European Parliament .
30127,it is not the governments that negotiate with NGOs .
30128,"as a member of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I would"
30129,"I know that this is a great political achievement , a great political report , but the individual"
30130,what do I mean by that ?
30131,what I am saying is that oil policy can have an extraordinary impact on public opinion in
30132,you get used to the high prices .
30133,"now , the oil price is $ 30 a barrel , and there is no uprising"
30134,"what we must expect is that cooperation with existing bodies , with the judicial network ,"
30135,I think that the proposed rules on donations are clear and unambiguous .
30136,"above all , they ensure the essential transparency of party funding , because , as you"
30137,I think that this House should support the idea that all information on donations should be available to
30138,the best thing would be for the parties themselves to commit themselves to making all information on donations
30139,"in this sense , I would also like to give my approval to this proposal for a regulation"
30140,I also think that the amendments proposed by Parliament should facilitate the adoption of
30141,many of our amendments are based on concerns that have also been expressed in the

30143,I firmly believe that on this basis we will be able to reach agreement in the Council more
30144,what will happen next ?
30145,the Charter of Fundamental Rights is to become part of a future European constitutional treaty –
30146,the nation states retain their prominent position .
30147,they and only they can amend treaties by the usual ratification .
30148,this is expressed when we talk about the Constitutional Treaty rather than a Constitution .
30149,"if we want to be credible , we cannot copy the concepts of the 19"
30150,that is why it is absolutely right to say ‘ a federation of states ’ rather than
30151,"anyone who wants Europe to succeed must define the terms clearly , and anyone who"
30152,"we want Europe to succeed , which is why the foundations must be right , the terms"
30153,clarity of terms is the beginning of success !
30154,the European Parliament 's non-participation in this dialogue is more than a cosmetic fla

30156,"none of you who are involved in the dialogue there , neither the Council nor the Commission nor"
30157,"these public service police officers deserve not only our full solidarity or respect , but"

30174,I would ask you to inform the Council of this and to ask it to suspend Mr Hombach

30183,"I would like to say , however , that I am the vice-chair of this committee and"
30184,"I find it outrageous that even as a vice-chairman of a committee , you"
30185,this is really a procedure that is completely unacceptable !
30186,the Commission believes that it is important to improve relations between Turkey and Armenia in order to promote
30187,the Commission therefore warmly welcomes the recent initiatives by civil society in both countries to

30201,"Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to congratulate"
30202,I certainly had good discussions with the members of the previous government .
30203,"some of them were very efficient , but the whole thing was always seen from the perspective"
30204,that has changed .
30205,the European policy in the Balkans has not only been recognised by the new Croatian government
30206,it was therefore right to react quickly .

30232,it is an integral part of our agreement policy and is also stated in all negotiating

30237,"Nonetheless , today , the internal ratification procedures are still pending in three Member"
30238,this prevents the Community from becoming a party to the UN agreement .

30247,"in the Commission 's view , it is justified to subject only those farmers who join"
30248,in addition to these four key issues that arise in the context of the debate on the report

30250,"one of our objectives is therefore to eliminate this situation , which is very sad"

30254,now to the amendments to these proposals made by the Commission :
30255,a number of the amendments in Mr Daul 's report are largely aimed

30257,"we recommend , however , that this be made conditional on the Bulgarian Government agreeing on accept"

30264,"Mr President , I was in Strasbourg on time yesterday , but last week in Brussel"
30265,"I would ask you to take note of this , too ."
30266,that is why we should all the more welcome the radically new approach proposed by the Commission
30267,"for the first time , a general food law with uniform definitions and principles is proposed"
30268,this food law is based on a comprehensive and uniform concept – from producer to consumer –

30276,"it would have been easy to reject the French Government 's proposals , which I have"
30277,"it would really be the easiest thing for us to do , to simply declare this"

30300,we will therefore not be able to present a second package until next year .

30302,that is what we are currently dealing with on a daily basis in this area in the European

30315,a final comment : the Commission rightly mentions the need for coordination of tax policies

30332,"I think that this is in your interests , Commissioner !"
30333,allow me to make a brief political preamble to this question .
30334,I am sometimes a little surprised that the Commission is asked questions which give the impression that we
30335,that is why we must set the priorities of our work in a sensible way .
30336,the cross-border aspects should first be in the foreground .
30337,compatibility must be established between European regulations on the one hand and national regulations on
30338,"the courts must cooperate better , and legal assistance must be guaranteed ."
30339,"I believe that these are very concrete , practical steps that we can take overnight and that"

30342,"it is very welcome that this prestigious research institution is fighting back and , with the support"
30343,the European Parliament would certainly not be wrong to adopt this position .

30346,we owe that to the women concerned .
30347,that is the least we can do for them at this time .
30348,"to discourage the skeptics , I am convinced that there is no one in this House"
30349,"the same applies to the Commission and , moreover , to the Council of Ministers ."

30359,"to make this clear , too : they do not benefit Spain , as they have claimed ,"
30360,I would therefore like to make it quite clear once again that our group – as we have
30361,"however , it is unacceptable that the Council 's proposal ignores the European Parliament ;"
30362,the rapporteur should therefore be supported in his attempt to change this .
30363,the new round of negotiations will also include the core points of the European demands .
30364,I do not need to repeat the details .
30365,what is important is that we in the European Union can introduce our ideas of a social and ec

30367,the prevention of the return of refugees at various levels has certainly also led to hope

30369,"we must call on all those responsible in the region , and particularly in Bosnia-Her"
30370,"nevertheless , we will probably have to continue to argue about the wishes of the"
30371,"they want to shape the fine-tuning of migration themselves , even though their strategies"
30372,I expect that we will soon be able to convince our colleagues at national level that
30373,"in this cross-party resolution , we are calling for the ' polluter pays ' principle"
30374,we also call for unbureaucratic aid for fishermen and aquaculture operators
30375,"however , this must not lead to a permanent subsidy that distorts competition ."
30376,we also call for safer maritime transport and for better monitoring in general .

30387,I would like to ask Mr Vitorino a question before we proceed to the final vote .
30388,you said this morning that you would support Amendment No 19 if it was vote
30389,I just wanted to have confirmation that you will indeed accept Amendment No 1
30390,"I agree with those who have pointed out that , despite all the concerns , there"
30391,the new government has been democratically elected .
30392,we have the impression that it is committed to tackling the pressing problems .
30393,it is trying to resolve the regional unrest that has been mentioned here in Aceh and I
30394,I know that the Commission is therefore seeking to take account of the priorities it has
30395,"so far , so good ."
30396,we can also support that .
30397,but what about Parliament 's priorities ?
30398,"we discussed our priorities at an early stage , both among ourselves and with the"
30399,"you have just highlighted a few points , but when we see that education and youth policy are"
30400,that is perfectly normal and we have supported it .
30401,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very happy ."
30402,"if I may now turn to the subject of our debate , 2002 is in"

30410,I only think that it should be as little ethnically determined as possible and should focus

30412,we will have an opportunity to deal with this issue in a factual way when we discuss
30413,"a member of your group is now the rapporteur , a well-known politician who is"
30414,his report will give us the opportunity to argue or discuss this issue in a factual way

30419,I am informed that there are only minor points in which the government could have accommod
30420,I don 't know .
30421,I do not think that is the decisive point .
30422,the crucial thing is that a solution is found to which we can commit ourselves .
30423,there has been a lot of talk today about Nordic culture .
30424,I welcome that .
30425,"the Ombudsman is a Nordic invention , but we are not the Nordic Community"
30426,the idea of supranational law is a Roman achievement .
30427,that is why I was very pleased to hear something that Mr Gemelli said .
30428,he said : ' the crucial thing is that people feel they are European citizens .
30429,""" one could also say it in Latin : ' Civis europaeis sum.'"

30439,"otherwise , the KLA can claim that it has more influence than it actually has ."
30440,"if we move in this direction , then I believe that it is a good development ."
30441,"Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me say at the outset that"
30442,we also urgently need a common strategy to improve management .
30443,"this requires a corresponding staffing requirement , and here too we have a criticism of"
30444,we are afraid that the majority in the committee has become branched .

30463,that is why both parties must end their violent confrontation .

30503,"but in substance , this is of course the same statement and means for the Turkish Government that"
30504,"as far as the linking of transitional periods is concerned , this is an automatic"
30505,we will be witnessing what is known as the ‘ final game ’ of the negotiations
30506,these will essentially be requests for transitional periods .
30507,"whether we call it formally or not , you can imagine how such a negotiating"
30508,"this will be a negotiation , and one of the principles of negotiation is"
30509,these mechanisms date back to a time when most foodstuffs were still in short supply
30510,but we have long left this time behind us .
30511,now there is surplus and abundance in the major markets .
30512,"the linking of support to production is an incentive , almost a compelling call ,"
30513,Intensification leads to environmental pollution and marginalization of less productive sites .

30519,"my partner is Magister Leitner , and if I have a problem in the field of"
30520,"this is excellent for Europe because it allows for technically correct , competent and quick help"
30521,"Mr President , I would just like to say , in response to Mr van den Berg 's"
30522,the only difference is that the Structural Funds are not applied for by the Commission or
30523,so if governments want to use the Structural Funds for language development and the promotion
30524,then it is of course very important that national parliamentarians urge their governments to take

30526,I therefore very much welcome the fact that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten 's report
30527,Macedonia did not have a war .
30528,but it has suffered from the war in its neighbourhood and from the sanctions
30529,it has suffered infinitely under the refugee flow in the Kosovo war .
30530,that is why it must be said that development in Macedonia has been surprisingly democratic .
30531,it is a country that has to deal with difficult inter-ethnic problems internally and
30532,I would like to point out that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation
30533,"let us be flexible , also on the issues of free movement , so that we do not create"
30534,we need solutions which are of course in the interests of both the European Union and the candidate
30535,I recommend that we try to ensure the necessary flexibility .
30536,"incidentally , but you know that , we also think that one per cent is far too"
30537,"the value should be at least less than half , because that can be done analytically ."
30538,"if we assume that these are unintended contaminations , then , Mr Liikanen , you"
30539,"I think that has nothing , but nothing at all , to do with it ."
30540,"Madam President , this calls for some remarks ."

30557,I have always attached great importance to the European Union also dealing with very sensitive issues

30559,"I would strongly urge that this programme be continued , expanded ambitiously and ,"
30560,"I am thinking of the Joint Research Centre , whose achievements so far should also be highlight"

30565,the proposal now presented by the Commission is based on this convention .
30566,"in doing so , the Commission exercises its right of initiative in the Community area of judicial"
30567,the United Kingdom and Ireland have declared their wish to participate fully in the Community 's

30573,there is therefore a link between the task that the Convention has to perform and enlargement .
30574,the Convention must make the European Union truly capable of enlargement .

30576,"it provides for the creation of 51 posts in this area , as well as other"
30577,I would like to make one thing quite clear here : we will of course undertake an intensiv
30578,it is in fact unacceptable for the Council to create a parallel structure for responsibilities which
30579,"however , as long as this is not the case , I do not see any need to recommend"
30580,I think it is important that we know which Members have tabled which amendments .
30581,"in this respect , it must be an exceptional situation that we are having a debate without having"
30582,this is a very unusual procedure and that is why Sir Atkins is right in principle !
30583,but we are now at a point where we can no longer postpone this .
30584,"I therefore ask you , Madam President , to start the debate , but I would ask you"
30585,the Commission is currently examining how to make further progress on the conditions for the cross-border

30589,"on August 12 , one of the greatest natural disasters that this country has ever"
30590,"to name just one figure : on that day , it rained 360 litres"
30591,I think that some Member States would be happy to have some of this water in their country as

30593,thousands of people lost everything they owned within hours .
30594,"traders and tradesmen lost not only their shops and their businesses , but also"
30595,probably 21 people had to pay the flood with their lives .
30596,"the preservation of solidarity-based pension systems is possible , even under current and future conditions"

30622,"my concern is that we are increasingly encountering situations in Europe , which I hope"

30630,slimming down to the point of falling over cannot be our goal .

30637,have you never heard of drug dealers and money launderers ’ couriers with a suit
30638,do I really have to open up a catalogue of travelling crime ?
30639,"secondly , the situation is that the electronic media of television are still mainly national markets"
30640,"Mrs Krehl , I must say quite clearly that I do not understand why the SPD"
30641,"at that time , I would have liked to have seen a similarly clear position from Mr"

30685,this is also possible in the Irish Sea at dark night .

30689,the Commission has presented an action plan for the period up to 2006 .
30690,"it is very ambitious , very committed and very concrete when it comes to the object"

30696,"parental control systems must therefore allow for an individual , pluralistic approach ."
30697,"the Commission also takes this as its starting point , referring to the results of the study ."
30698,this is ultimately also supported by the report that is being voted on here .
30699,it is undoubted that media representations can influence values .
30700,competition law and the freedom of workers make this necessary .
30701,Mrs Reding has already rightly stated this .
30702,that is why I am all the more sorry for the lack of capacity for learning and dialogue
30703,"if you look at the statements of the last few days , you have to have the impression"
30704,in general – and Mr Jarzembowski has already mentioned this – we have now been

30706,"we hope that she will soon come up with a good proposal for us in this area , so"

30714,"secondly , we are all of the opinion that , after the explosive increases in oil"

30717,"with just over three months left , we don ’ t have much time for a final decision ."
30718,"given the speedy work you have done here in Parliament , I hope that the Council will"

30737,"thirdly , the new Member States should not be in a worse financial position after accession"
30738,it goes without saying that we cannot allow the poorest members that we will have to pay for
30739,a net position of the new members from the start is therefore absolutely unacceptable .
30740,"Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate and thank the Commissioner for her"
30741,she has put herself into the work with a lot of interest and enthusiasm .
30742,"unfortunately , however , the feeling is not everywhere as it is in Luxembourg , and"

30773,only by improving working hours will we be able to have more rested bus drivers
30774,"this , of course , also includes more controls , and I am pleased that the Commission"
30775,"Mr President , I voted in favour of this Charter , not least because of the influence"
30776,I thank both of them for their great work .
30777,there are of course some things that you have to complain about .
30778,"the reference to God in the preamble is missing , as is a clear definition of marriage and"
30779,but it must be said that this Charter is a step in the right direction .
30780,the colleagues I mentioned earlier and others have done an excellent job here .
30781,"that is why we voted in favour , in the hope that this is only a first"
30782,enlargement is not just a cost-benefit question .
30783,"it was the Polish trade union movement Solidarity , it was the Hungarian government that opened the"

30786,this is why we have a moral and historical obligation to make the accession of the people

30821,there are three options for upgrading the relevant IT system : to continue with the current system
30822,the first option - you have noticed from my words - is rejected by the Commission .
30823,"as regards the second and third options , there will be a feasibility study to be"
30824,then it is decided which further development steps to an integrated system are possible .
30825,but now seriously .
30826,the enlarging Union needs to be strengthened by slimming and limiting .
30827,"first , slimming ."
30828,what you say in your programme about concentrating on the Commission 's core tasks can only

30832,a lawsuit will not endanger the European Cooperative .
30833,"firstly , the validity of the regulation on cooperative societies is linked to the"
30834,this period should actually provide enough room for a clarification by the ECJ .
30835,"secondly , the Court may , upon application , declare that the legal effects of a regulation"
30836,"it is therefore only the choice of the legal basis that is being targeted , not the"
30837,only if you set a signal here with our support can we exert pressure so that we finally

30839,we also travel with delegations to the fishing regions of Europe to address the issues on the

30842,"this is a very topical and urgent issue , especially as we are on the verge of the"
30843,"not in the Solidarity Fund , but in our discussion today , we are calling for a future"
30844,"the flood disaster has shown that , despite all the commitment , there were"
30845,this must be remedied .
30846,"the Commission should first encourage or support joint exercises of fire services , technical assistance , civil protection"
30847,"in the medium term , this could result in a logistically unified aid network or even"
30848,"we should work on such a vision , not wait until the next disaster ."
30849,I do not want to forget to thank the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation .
30850,may I add one more question to the questions that colleagues have already asked you ?
30851,"what does closer contact with the citizens mean in institutional terms , beyond the Internet and discussion"
30852,does this mean that the European Parliament will be disempowered by a second parliamentary
30853,I ask for answers .
30854,I would also like to emphasise that a reform of the establishment law in Luxembourg
30855,I would like to raise three points that are contained in our resolution .
30856,it is reasonable that the Stability Pact should be closely linked to the Stabil
30857,"it is important that the CARDS programme , which is receiving less and less funding ,"
30858,"there is money , we do not need to create new money ."
30859,"pre-accession aid has not been used up , and I regret that the Commissioner has"
30860,"I am sure you will not want to go beyond that amount now , but I believe that we"
30861,next week – on 1 October – the Commission will make a proposal for the sum we want
30862,this proposal will provide for the mobilisation of funds this year – EUR 40 million
30863,that will therefore be the proposal for the donor conference until the end of 20
30864,"the outcome of the Convention is not yet certain , let alone the commitment to rat"
30865,I find it hypocritical to approve enlargement but to sweep the unresolve
30866,"in the face of such an important decision by our Parliament , I would have liked to see"
30867,it makes no sense to discriminate against producers of agricultural alcohol on the one hand
30868,that is why we referred this issue back to the Committee on Agriculture weeks ago .
30869,the linguistic change in the new Commission proposal finally allows the Member States to adopt their own national
30870,only then can small distilleries survive within the EU .
30871,the matter is actually quite simple .
30872,we always talk about what could come .
30873,we have two chocolate markets in the single European internal market .
30874,"to be clear , there is already chocolate that contains the controversial 5 % of other"
30875,"for market participants , and therefore also for consumers , this market is characterised by"
30876,this must be eliminated !
30877,"Mr Lannoye , this cannot be done against the interests of the multinationals or with"
30878,I have spoken with medium-sized enterprises .
30879,they will be happy when this directive finally comes into effect !
30880,"the ESA Member States are being challenged , Galileo is being tested and we really have"
30881,that is the greatest and most important demand .
30882,"in this sense , I hope that tomorrow we will be able to reach a joint resolution ,"
30883,one area is the question of what this directive is supposed to do – to do in
30884,"on the one hand , we have the interests of the economy and also of the individual ."
30885,"in my remarks , I first assume that it is a righteous and solidly working individual"
30886,"on the other hand , there are the interests of the Member States , which may have to"

30888,the completion of the internal market for rail transport is certainly both desirable and

30901,but we have not achieved more transparency .
30902,"we are hopeful about the future , although we also see the good things , for example"
30903,"we take you at your word , President Chirac , and I was pleased to hear that"
30904,we expect from all the Member States of the European Union and their governments that there is a

30906,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
30907,"this time , it is not a fisheries issue that is at the end of our part"
30908,"we discussed this subject in great detail , it was not controversial , and therefore"
30909,"since I am here regularly on Fridays , this is not difficult for me personally ."
30910,"thirdly , what are the consequences ?"
30911,"what are the consequences of military action for our relations with the Arab and Islamic world , with"
30912,"I know how important it is to answer this question because I have just visited Saudi Arabia ,"
30913,"now we have the Convention that we wanted , and we therefore also have responsibility for the"
30914,we must not overlook this !
30915,the Convention 's outcome will have political weight if it is supported by the broadest
30916,we will therefore have to contribute to the Convention 's work on a draft treat
30917,only that will have a chance of binding the Intergovernmental Conference as well !

30919,the consequence is that equality and women ’ s rights in rural areas are almost invisible

30921,"I think that the reform of agricultural policy was a battlefield for lobbyists ,"
30922,"this is particularly painful , but it will have an even more painful impact on the"
30923,"Commissioner Fischler , I would like to appeal to you to take up the amendments"
30924,"I could not explain this to my farmers , to the consumers , or to the el"
30925,what are we actually demanding ?
30926,"first of all , we ask that you do not change the rules of the game in the middle"
30927,the rules of the game were set in Berlin .
30928,we are calling for the reintroduction of a limit of 90 animals .
30929,I think that we from the most diverse regions really have to insist on this at the present time
30930,I must say quite frankly that I cannot explain to the farmers in my region the plan
30931,"Mr President , I very much welcome this eContent programme and would like to draw attention to"
30932,"firstly , digital technology reminds us that it is high time to make a treasure that"
30933,"it is Europe 's cultural diversity , and we now have the opportunity to secure it"
30934,"eContent shows that Europe is not only an economic community , but also a community of value"
30935,I should like to thank the general rapporteur for the good cooperation with my colleagues
30936,"in the past , there have been several complaints to the Ombudsman , whom we have"
30937,"it is therefore important that these things are carried out as transparently , as comprehensi"
30938,"in response to the questions from your general rapporteur on contracts with EUROGRAMME , the"
30939,"in all cases where this does not involve additional costs , the contractual relationship will be terminated"
30940,they now also ask the Commission to review all contracts concluded by the Statistical Office
30941,that is 2 660 contracts .
30942,that is not feasible until July .
30943,"but precisely because we want to meet Parliament 's concerns , we must find a fea"
30944,the Commission will present an overview of these contracts to the Committee on Budgetary Control at

30946,"last but not least , the Italian Government has been very helpful by sending a member of"
30947,this action was ultimately successful .
30948,I would also like to express my thanks to the Ambassador of the People 's Republic of Laos
30949,it would really be a good sign for the EU if it launched a political initiative in the
30950,I would like to make one final point of principle :
30951,both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner mentioned the stabilisation and association agreement
30952,"in fact , such an agreement has also been initialled with Croatia ."
30953,"however , we need to think a step further ."
30954,I believe that the region as a whole must be able to feel at home in Europe .
30955,"I would like to suggest that we consider whether it would not be possible to check , in principle"
30956,"for when I look at Bulgaria and Romania on the one hand and Turkey on the other , there"
30957,"in Zagreb , a lot was done well ."
30958,but I believe that we should go one step further and tell the region clearly and unambigu
30959,"we , as the European Union , are prepared to review the agreements with those countries with"
30960,"only the path to Europe , only the vision , the realistic vision of belonging to"
30961,"not in the short term , but in the medium and long term , this must be possible ,"
30962,I think that the idea and spirit of the Convention should also guide the IGC .
30963,"that is why governments should meet in public and transparently , because citizens have a right to"
30964,I consider the upgrading of Jörg Haider as “ the man of Europe ” –
30965,"of course , I do not agree with the published statements of this right-wing populist"
30966,"I fear , however , that a merely emotional European reaction to the events in Austria will"
30967,the EU must not give him a PR effect that is priceless .
30968,"Mr President , I would like to add what was said earlier but could not be answered"
30969,"I would like to ask Mr Dell 'Alba once again to explain what I , as Chairman of"
30970,I need an answer to this and I would ask that this be included in the Minutes .
30971,I am grateful to the European Parliament for making it possible for us to go to the
30972,this will also show how seriously we in the European Parliament take our support for peaceful development in
30973,the Heads of State or Government of the European Union have just reaffirmed at the
30974,when you see the enthusiasm with which the euro was welcomed on 1 January
30975,"on the other hand , however , we must also ask ourselves what the prerequisit"
30976,"that is what is at stake , and in this respect we have to correct some of what the"
30977,and the way in which the institutions and authorities of a Member State guarantee this is a matter
30978,it just has to be clear and reliable for all market participants .
30979,then there is the requirement of budgetary discipline for the European budget .
30980,"what we demand of the Member States also applies to the European budget , and bringing all"
30981,"a second problem I would like to raise in relation to this report , which seeks to"
30982,"in Germany , this has led to racist behaviour , to the fact that the author"
30983,it has been said that you can tell whether someone is illegal or not when they stand at the
30984,so they were told : these people can be recognized !
30985,"no person is illegal , and it is not possible to tell whether a person is illegal or not"
30986,"let me say a word about hemp , because there are always misunderstandings ."
30987,"the risk of drug cultivation is not present in Europe , and the use of hemp seed"
30988,I believe that the existing control mechanisms and the limits in force are sufficient to

30990,"the chemical industry is the third largest manufacturing sector in Europe , and the figures , as given"
30991,"with this report , we are also deciding on their future ."
30992,"the Schörling report clearly aims at environmental concerns , and there is a fear that"
30993,"Mr President , I would like to say something briefly about the next amendment ."
30994,it is about torture .
30995,it is wonderful that there is no amendment condemning torture in the strongest terms
30996,have the candidate countries fulfilled all the conditions ?
30997,"from our point of view , there is certainly still a lot to be done ."
30998,"in many countries , the implementation of the acquis communautaire is still very poor ."
30999,"deciding on things is one thing , implementing them is another ."
31000,"in some countries there are still discriminatory provisions regarding origin and gender , but this can"
31001,the use of the financial resources is sometimes deficient .
31002,"I also remember , however , that even after accession , my country , for example , did"
31003,we should not set too strict criteria here .
31004,"as far as the promises are concerned , as far as the environment is concerned ,"
31005,"Fifthly , the Employment Pact adopted in Cologne aims to accompany"
31006,the Pact improves the conditions for active employment policies at both national and European level
31007,"the macroeconomic dialogue agreed in Cologne , involving the social partners and the European"
31008,the Employment Summit under the Portuguese Presidency will therefore be the first opportunity to take
31009,I would like to draw the Commission and the Council 's attention to our insistence that the

31011,I only hope that this will be passed on to the Council and that it will follow in Mrs
31012,"otherwise , I hope that we will work together on what is laid down in this work"
31013,"the third point is a very important one , namely that legal assistance will also be improved"
31014,Mrs Palacio has emphatically pointed out how necessary it is to involve the relevant professional

31016,consumers demand comprehensive information on the processing and health value of meat and meat

31024,the structure of the agencies does not make it easy for us to find a uniform line in

31027,"I think that if we move in this direction together , we will be taking a significant step forward"
31028,"with Agenda 2000 , we have tried to take account of the concerns of"
31029,"in some market organisations , we have at least created the possibility of granting special conditions"
31030,just think of the sheep premiums or the management of the national milk quota reserves or plant

31038,"on behalf of a minority in our group , I would like to express some concerns"

31044,what 's going on ?
31045,this is a typical example of how this Europe is not yet fit together .
31046,"we urgently need reforms , or how many dentists will still stumble over the Commission"
31047,my personal preference is that we should make biometric risks very clearly apparent and
31048,"of the three biometric risks , my preference is for longevity , which I"
31049,but we should not set a system today .
31050,"the world is still turning , the financial markets are still turning , and we should"
31051,"we must create space for subsidiarity in the competition between systems , but also in the competition"
31052,I hope that the Commission will be up to the task .
31053,"the US system , for example , shows us that health care costs , measured as a percentage"
31054,this has nothing to do with sensible social policy .

31067,I would like to convey this to you in the knowledge that I personally had very little

31079,"Mr President , I believe that we are today in a situation where not only the European Parliament must"
31080,there must be answers to the uncertainty of consumers .
31081,the Member States must finally do their homework faster than in the past .
31082,"we have examples on many pages where the Commission was first pushed , then finally acted"
31083,this must end .
31084,there must also be answers to some of the attacks that simply violate and question the
31085,"this is no longer permissible , as is happening in some cases ."
31086,the Heads of State or Government must find an answer to this .
31087,we need to answer whether we really want to overcome the crisis .

31094,"now , however , those who must continue this work that has been begun are called upon ."
31095,the Ministries of Interior and Justice of the Turkish Republic play an important role in this area .
31096,"the functioning and integrity of the European administrative body , the Commission , is particularly important"

31106,the method of the Intergovernmental Conference has become obsolete because decisions of such importance

31109,"Madam President , we would not need this debate today if all the Member States had immediately"
31110,I also want to acknowledge that the Commission has made great progress in recent years in

31114,I can already report the execution of this .

31119,"Mr President , I would just like to refer to the remark made by the previous speaker , Mr"
31120,he compares the EUR 32 million requested with a donation that we paid to
31121,that is not the case .
31122,this money is for the whole European Union .
31123,"this can be read in the minutes , and it is being handled in such a way ,"
31124,I wanted to make that a correction .
31125,"secondly , it is interesting that the particular pressure has come from the Americans , the American"
31126,"that is interesting , and the European Union should urge the Americans to finally recognise"

31137,I would like to make three very brief points .
31138,"firstly , the Presidency 's conclusions refer to considerable progress with regard to the"
31139,"I must say that I find this difficult to understand , because everyone knows that the IGC"
31140,"in the meantime , additional ministerial meetings have been scheduled and the German media reported today"
31141,"therefore , third-party certification is crucial , especially for safety components ."
31142,we have seen in the Eschede railway accident that very serious accidents can happen if the

31146,several Members want to extend pre-trade transparency to bonds as well .
31147,"as the two markets are very differently structured , I have spoken out against this"

31158,"in June , the first World Congress against the Death Penalty was held in Strasbourg"
31159,"I welcome events of this kind , which seek ways to abolish the death penalty ."
31160,I consider the death penalty to be a barbaric institution .
31161,the death penalty is cruel and inhuman .
31162,I condemn all 87 states that still have the death penalty and call on those responsible

31173,"this linguistic richness is diversity , it is an asset , and many of these minorities"
31174,the European Commission recognised this in time in its action plan and an inclusive approach .
31175,I would like to make a special and explicit mention of Commissioner Reding for this initiative
31176,"the 90-animal limit does not refer to cows , but only to the support"
31177,this is the ratio ;
31178,we have already made this proposal in connection with Agenda 2000 .

31180,there was indeed a negotiation and we agreed on a joint motion for a

31184,"I wanted to say that just to clarify the procedure , and the vote will decide on the"
31185,I therefore think that the debate on the escalation is too early now .
31186,"you , the Commission , should also implement and examine the measures that have now been agreed"
31187,I regret that there has not been more impetus during this Swedish Presidency .

31193,"environment and consumer protection : no individual rights for citizens , and it is also regrettable that the"
31194,"on ethics , we have found a compromise here ."
31195,the Commission has made a statement which essentially corresponds to what the European Parliament decided at first
31196,"my request would be that we advance the debate on the finality of science , including ethics"
31197,"the real problem is not the Council , Parliament or the Commission , but the differences in public"
31198,"it would be important to contribute to the development of a broad public debate on the purpose ,"
31199,I would like to assure you that the European Parliament is interested in this .
31200,"I myself was one of the founders of STOA , I am aware of the important task"
31201,"I would also like to say that the rulers are enforcing their right to security ,"
31202,it is absurd that you stand here and say : ‘ What you have said is absolutely correct
31203,"that is why you , Mr Prodi , cannot say that , because I want Mr Berlu"
31204,that is your problem .
31205,please settle this in your group and leave us alone and let Mr Prodi do politics as

31207,"so we expect real cooperation , and that from now on ."
31208,"we expect increased control , because EU money is not anonymous , it is the taxpayers"
31209,we also expect a precise definition of the political responsibility of this Commission .
31210,"I will vote for you and your team , because you alone are responsible for this College"
31211,"it is in your hands , Mr President , to ensure that Parliament 's signals are correct"
31212,one thing I already know :
31213,"when criticism is justified , this Parliament will not be comforted for weeks with the argument"
31214,"our confidence is not a blank cheque , but an offer of constructive cooperation by many"
31215,this inevitably means that these objective disadvantages can only be compensated for in the
31216,this article should enable the outermost regions not to be subject to permanent budget cuts
31217,"just as you , Mrs Sudre , as a representative of the outermost regions ,"
31218,let us take Mozambique and the ECHO deployment as an example .
31219,ECHO provided EUR 750 000 for the most vulnerable people at

31221,the Member States also reacted quickly .
31222,the total aid from the European Union and its member states amounts to 85 million
31223,"for the reasons I have already mentioned , I could not support these essential amendments"

31246,I also do not fully agree with the way in which the voluntary scrapping measures propose
31247,"the emphasis is on voluntary , everything else is talk for me ."
31248,"I do not consider the two reports acceptable in their present form , and I cannot vote"
31249,one of our main demands is that all the proposed measures should also be supported

31269,this issue was also not taken into account by the Council at its first reading .
31270,"however , there is one lesson to be learned from this debate , and I am saying"
31271,we can see that the Corbett reform has brought us forward every day at noon during voting
31272,we have now gained time .
31273,the wrong consequence is that the time gained there is not used to carry out parliament

31313,I hope that the Finnish Presidency will actually succeed in this .

31318,"the problem-free operation will only be possible if we have sufficient pre-distribution ,"
31319,I would like to highlight just one aspect .
31320,it seems to me that the term trade is not yet clearly defined .

31328,"but I also believe that , from a consumer point of view , we need to change our mind"
31329,it is not helpful that we have reformed the block exemption regulation .

31397,"it is also a question of technology , as Chris Patten rightly said just now ."
31398,"this is not to be done in opposition to America , but as a complement ."
31399,"I believe that if we Europeans do our duty here , we will strengthen the North Atlantic"

31502,"they are deliberately refusing to join NAFO , which the European Union is a member"

31506,"may I , at the end of a sitting or almost at the end of the year ,"
31507,I was told that this is a special problem .
31508,but I think we have found a good solution to this problem as well .

31511,"however , these priority lists are not based solely on urgency and absolute necessity"
31512,"for example , freezing , confiscating the proceeds of illegally generated sectors"
31513,I could give other examples .

31531,everyone needs human closeness and contact with others .
31532,it is urgent to find a solution to prevent further deaths .
31533,"on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group , I therefore call on the Turkish"

31538,never since World War II has there been such an imbalance of economic and political power .
31539,"in this context , the possibility for workers and small and medium-sized enterprises"
31540,I cannot agree with this .
31541,"I think of Lessing , who said : “ If the light of the Enlightenment"
31542,"you have made the same mistake as with OLAF legislation , which in the end penetrated"
31543,there you will be stopped .

31545,"I said at the time , in connection with OLAF legislation , that the European Union as"

31564,"based on my experience in other areas and other negotiations with the Commission , I believe"
31565,my priorities for the WTO negotiations are :
31566,"firstly , electronic commerce , the area with the greatest growth potential , in which"
31567,we want to see a permanent duty-free regime for electronic transactions and deliveries .
31568,we want to avoid a differentiated approach between classical and new services – the way in which

31580,"I am pleased that there is no deadline for liberalisation , because the primary economic object"

31582,"the Djiboutian Government must know that there will be consequences if it , as a party"
31583,cooperation between the European Union and Djibouti cannot remain unaffected by this .
31584,we will therefore support all initiatives aimed at persuading the Djiboutian Government

31591,"firstly , Mr Modrow claimed last night that all we are doing there is to repair"

31596,what about trade sanctions ?
31597,have you solved this now ?
31598,the companies need the opportunity to trade now .

31600,"in conclusion , I would like to say that in all the conflicts we have with each other"
31601,this peaceful resolution of conflicts can only be achieved on the basis of law .
31602,that is why it is important that the way to the European Court of Justice is also made possible
31603,I hope that the proposal that Ursula Schleicher has put before us will be supported by

31616,"the major role played by the oil companies in this country , but also the diamond trade - criminal"
31617,"ethnic and political conflicts , which are mostly rooted in ethnic conflicts , are"
31618,"I therefore consider paragraph 7 of the resolution to be extremely important , because this is"
31619,we do indeed need such a report on the role of oil companies .
31620,the European Union must confront this development with a high degree of civil courage .

31622,"rapporteur . – Mr President , I would like to thank all the political groups for their support"
31623,this has enabled us to achieve a positive decision for MEDIA in the Council .
31624,we do not need a conciliation procedure and we can take a positive decision today .
31625,"however , if there is no constant updating , if there is no research , if there is"
31626,"we therefore need a new chapter in European space policy , and I very much welcome the positive"
31627,a coherent space policy strategy and precise lines of action are essential if Europe 's space
31628,but that is why we have decided to formulate today 's European Parliament resolution at this stage
31629,we cannot wait until Europe 's last rocket has been launched .
31630,"if that is the case , we will no longer be able to withstand competition from third parties"
31631,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too congratulate the rapporteur on her"
31632,"he brings things to the point , and that point is that we need more transparency and"
31633,I believe that a one-year period is not only appropriate but also very generous
31634,we have Member States with more committed timetables .
31635,we should try together to eliminate duplication in complaints .
31636,this has already been mentioned .
31637,"that is an objective of this House and , above all , of its Committee on Petitions"
31638,"Mr President , Mr Kinnock has made a very clear point about the danger this problem poses"
31639,"indeed , there is a fear that extremist forces will use this to impose a state"
31640,no one knows exactly what the background of these attacks is .
31641,what is happening in Russia is extremely worrying .
31642,"of course , we condemn any form of extremism , but we need to know the exact background"
31643,"as far as Chechnya and Dagestan are concerned , they are the late damages"
31644,we are moving closer together .
31645,"state borders , time zones , distances , quantitative sizes play an increasingly small"
31646,we are becoming increasingly dependent on each other .
31647,we bear increasing responsibility for each other worldwide .
31648,we are struck and affected .
31649,"globalisation is taking place , and it is about seizing the opportunities and fighting the risk"
31650,"in this context , we need a stronger Europe in the world ."
31651,we need a more just and equitable global economic and social order .
31652,"just as European policy is national domestic policy , so are the issues of the world economic and social"
31653,we need more European unity and strength !
31654,"Sixthly , and lastly , we want to suspend the existing ceiling of 3"
31655,"Mr President , the Socialist Group and I personally particularly welcome this agreement between the European Community"
31656,it is a step in the right direction .
31657,"Switzerland is in the middle of Europe , but not yet in the Union ."
31658,the conclusion of the bilateral negotiations with Switzerland will set the Union 's relationship with Switzerland
31659,this exchange of lists is not the optimal form of dialogue .
31660,we should therefore think of something else in future .
31661,"I would ask you , Mr President of the Commission , to include an assessment of your success"
31662,"that seems to me to be much more sensible than what we are practicing this week again ,"
31663,"I would like to express my thanks to the Commission and the Council , both of which have worked"

31687,let me reiterate a few specific points .
31688,you are right to call for better information on the state of stocks and for more investment in
31689,"as regards research , the Commission currently has a total of EUR 35 million available for"
31690,I am sorry to say that this funding will decrease somewhat in the coming years
31691,"finally , I would like to say that I very much hope that the Turkish Government in Ankara"
31692,"the time window is tight , but it is still available ."
31693,"and in every respect , it would be better to be able to organise Cyprus ' accession"
31694,"Mr President , I am coming to my conclusion ."
31695,"we must , of course , improve market access for agricultural products from developing countries ."
31696,but we should also point out that other highly developed countries in this world should finally move more strong
31697,"as a member of the ACP delegation , I support the work on this resolution as a"
31698,my esteemed colleague Mrs Fraisse and Mrs Hieronymi have already said the

31701,I said that this is not enough .
31702,"we need to do more here , and I am in the process of realizing that ."
31703,"I will also be as flexible as we can be , while respecting the law ."
31704,we are also prepared to work with the Spanish Government to see how we can best use the
31705,"we also want to be flexible enough to include in this compensation scheme , for example , activities"
31706,"we do indeed have a Stability and Growth Pact , which gives us many opportunities"
31707,it is no coincidence that the examination of the convergence criteria has already involved
31708,I am not saying this to speak for a community of instability .

31711,"what is necessary in this context - Madam President-in-Office , you have rightly"
31712,we can only do this if we show the structural deficits in the updated budget figures
31713,"I believe that this would help to remove the excitement from this debate in this House and ,"
31714,the European Union needs both monetary stability and employment and social stability .
31715,"in addition , there are a number of other improvements that we have achieved ."
31716,"on the issue of anonymity , there is better wording , Parliament 's rights in the"
31717,"because of the small improvements in these areas , which clarify and clarify the common position"
31718,we look at another problem with exactly the same critical eye .
31719,we are seeing that Parliament is increasingly wanting to interfere in OLAF 's
31720,"we believe that OLAF must be and remain truly independent , and not that its independence"
31721,we think that is wrong .
31722,real independence also means administrative independence .
31723,"at the ASEP meeting , which some of my colleagues attended under the leadership of"
31724,"I had the opportunity to be the coordinator there , and I would like to ask you ,"
31725,I will take the liberty of highlighting a few proposals .
31726,we unanimously proposed that the UN should try to find a uniform definition of terrorism that
31727,"we have decided to set up a network for cooperation in the fight against terrorism , for the"
31728,we proposed that improvements should be made with defined standards in the field of security
31729,"finally , two questions ."
31730,"firstly , has there been any improvement in budget implementation in 2001 ?"
31731,the answer is given by the discharge decision .
31732,"secondly , under the Treaty , the Commission is responsible for the entire budgetary management"
31733,the new Financial Regulation creates decentralised responsibility for its Directorates-General .
31734,but who in the Commission is responsible for the control as a whole within the Commission ?
31735,"the individual directors-general , the Directorate-General for Budgets or the accounting"
31736,"in any case , Commissioner Schreyer , you are and will of course remain our main contact"
31737,I am also opposed to the call for a reform of the CAP which would include food
31738,"our agricultural policy is based on the principle of multifunctionality and family farming ,"
31739,we would be sending the wrong signal .
31740,that is why the Austrian People 's Party delegation here in the European Parliament abs

31744,"the measure to keep 25 % of the flexibility instrument , which is entitle"
31745,I therefore refer to the documents from Germany on Tampere .
31746,I regret that we are once again having a debate in this House on domestic policy without having the

31748,"I still have hope , but the experience has already made me pessimistic ."
31749,I hope that the Finnish Presidency will take our concerns seriously .
31750,the report rightly refers to a number of guidelines for combating poverty .
31751,"for reasons of time , I cannot go into more detail ."
31752,"the careful observer will notice , however , that there is a balance between different weightings ."
31753,these are expressed in phrases such as : “ supporting least developed countries in particular
31754,"I am glad that I do not have to belong to those who daily distinguish between """
31755,"when we talk about water management in developing countries , it is clear to me that the Commission"
31756,I think that the report by Paul Lannoye is so good because it addresses the problems and
31757,"he mentions intensive agriculture , which is mainly export-oriented , structural"
31758,I believe that this is a very good signal and that there are also very good approaches to
31759,"secondly , the Commission has carried out a global assessment of the state of preparation"
31760,it notes that considerable progress has been made in incorporating the old ex ante controls into
31761,problems that remain will receive the concentrated effort of all involved and continued attention .
31762,the horizontal services will provide targeted support .
31763,this brings me to the problem I want to raise .
31764,"in addition to the necessary and very decisive criticism of the situation in Turkey , do"
31765,"since Helsinki , and even there , it seems to me that the Council and the Commission are prison"
31766,"on 14 November , you , Mr Verheugen , told us here , and I"
31767,"however , there have also been some positive developments since the last debate here on the Iraq war"
31768,"the Turkish parliament has rejected a war march on its territory , at least for the"
31769,"in Britain , over 200 Labour MPs have spoken out against the war ."
31770,they deserve our highest respect .
31771,the renewal and modernisation of employment in the Member States naturally also requires
31772,the basis for this is the participation and information of the workers .
31773,"the Commission must step up its efforts in this area , because there is still a great deal"
31774,I believe that we have found the balance between the Europe of the states and the Europe of the
31775,"we are the Chamber of Citizens , Parliament is the Chamber of Citizens , the Council of"
31776,the balance is not yet there .
31777,Parliament is excluded from a whole series of important issues that parliaments normally have to decide
31778,I therefore hope that this Intergovernmental Conference will seize the opportunity to finally establi
31779,why am I mentioning this ?
31780,it 's very simple !
31781,the appalling patent with its background and the disappearance of a parliamentary question show
31782,this would be the way to a catastrophe that destroys the inviolability of
31783,it is clear that everything must be done to eliminate Patent 695 / 35
31784,it is clear that we must close the legal gap of the lack of a European patent as
31785,"it is clear that we must quickly create a path open to everyone towards an independent patent court ,"
31786,we know that the historical waste reaches enormous quantities .
31787,66 % of all these devices are older than 10 years and about
31788,binding collection targets are therefore very important .
31789,that is why we have been fighting for the 6 kg .
31790,we want recycling to be done really properly and on a scale that makes sense for the
31791,"in paragraph 18 , Parliament proposes that a compendium of examples of successful"
31792,I can only say that this already exists .
31793,it has already been prepared by the Commission and I can make it available to any interested Member
31794,"in reality , there are two alternative models :"
31795,that it remains as it is is no alternative for me .
31796,"one alternative is that we become a military power like the US , just a little less powerful ,"
31797,I find this unacceptable .
31798,"the other alternative is that we have a military backbone for a common foreign and security policy ,"
31799,we are not currently .
31800,the Morillon report shows us ways in which we can act efficiently in the multilateral
31801,that is why we clearly support the Morillon report .
31802,"I particularly support an amendment tabled by my group to paragraph 10,"
31803,"I would be delighted , Mrs Schroedter , if you could include this amend"
31804,we will of course discuss this on several occasions during the entire budgetary process .
31805,"however , if the legal basis – and it would be a good legal basis that would enable"
31806,I therefore ask for the urgency to be approved .
31807,"for far too long , trade in traditional products within the Community has been hampered by differences"
31808,"I believe that the directive as it stands will remedy this problem , thanks also to"
31809,we also call for a tax system that promotes innovation on the one hand and also encourages
31810,I therefore also welcome the fact that it was agreed in Lisbon to introduce benchmarking
31811,I would like to begin my remarks by referring to the current situation in Belgium and at

31826,I would like to raise a few points that are important to me .
31827,it is absolutely necessary to correct the number of seats for the Czech Republic and Hungary
31828,there must be no discrimination against these two countries in their parliamentary representation in this House
31829,"the post-Nice period must undertake an ambitious , truly profound reform"
31830,"firstly , the progress made towards integration must not be reversed , and I would like"
31831,"the many dramatic illness and life circumstances , which also affect the relatives , force"
31832,the EU must play a strategic role in improving equal access to therapy and treatment
31833,MS patients in the future Member States will benefit from this .
31834,"Mr President , I too would like to thank Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro for this"
31835,I am sure that we will see that tomorrow in the vote .
31836,"I would also like to note , however , that for the first time , the European Parliament is"
31837,this is new and a difference from Maastricht and Amsterdam .
31838,I believe that this should be a wake-up call for the governments that negotiated
31839,we are not saying a clear ' yes ' because we are not satisfied with the results
31840,"the state 's attempts to regulate individual consumption have serious consequences , however , because"

31842,"if we are not only concerned about security and waiting until security is restored , and I"
31843,"in practical implementation , it is now important that the political will exists in the EU"
31844,but we all know how it is in practice .
31845,human rights issues are repeatedly pushed aside or even perceived as disturbing
31846,"either a lucrative business is at risk , or you need the consent or support of this"

31853,I regret that we were unable to set binding national targets .
31854,"more importantly , I consider the present definition of renewable energy to be simply wrong ."
31855,"to make it easier for them to achieve the target , individual Member States have insisted"
31856,"this not only counteracts the European objective of waste prevention and treatment , but also"

31860,at a time when we are putting enormous strain on the term 'social dimension'

31863,"none of us has achieved the maximum , but it is precisely through this optimum that it"
31864,congratulations on having the courage to start something new !
31865,I would like to see more of this in other areas as well .
31866,why is this so ?
31867,is it the European Central Bank ?
31868,we must say clearly no to this .
31869,the European Union is in good financial shape .
31870,the European Central Bank has all the instruments that can be available to a central bank .
31871,the European Central Bank is headed by convincing personalities .
31872,"they have also fulfilled their mandate to ensure price stability , and the interest rate policy"
31873,so it cannot be the European Central Bank .
31874,let me give you some figures on the disadvantages of these areas .
31875,six of the seven outermost regions have an average per capita income between 40 and

31887,we wanted it to be included in Article 128 – under culture – as a separate

31889,"there is something like a declaration annexed to the Treaty , but it is not enough"
31890,"I think that if everything you have said , everything you will present to the Council in Helsinki ,"
31891,"only then can we do what Mr Cohn-Bendit has said , and only then can"

31903,that is why we urgently need this joint reform !
31904,I think that we must first of all – and this was also already established in Copenhagen – meet
31905,we need to be able to focus on what we have in common .
31906,we must make the EU capable of internal enlargement .

31908,the European Parliament has today approved the accession of ten countries to the European Union .
31909,this is a historic day – both for Europe and for me personally .
31910,"the unfortunate division of Europe will be overcome , Europe will be united in peace and"
31911,the peoples of Europe now have the opportunity to shape the future together in freedom and democracy .
31912,"Community action must be possible wherever it can create improved , greater European added value ."
31913,this strength of Community action must be emphasised especially now .
31914,"firstly , because , especially in view of the imminent enlargement , we need a"
31915,I agree with Mr Hager that we should include the providers in the obligation .
31916,I think that is a point of concern that Mr Kirkhope should take into account in his report
31917,"in future , we want to send these funds to those who really need them , and that is"
31918,"above all , we are talking about the many fishermen who are actually about to retire but"
31919,is it a social attitude if we continue to ignore it or pretend that it is not

31923,"Mr President , I have just received confirmation from various fisheries ministers in Iceland in"
31924,"these fisheries ministers came from the USA , Chile , Norway , Sri Lanka , Tunisia"

31926,there are rare enough real political decisions .
31927,"instead , they are all hasty to add a little extra shine to their personal or national"
31928,it is worthwhile to review and revise Directive 9243 once again
31929,citizens have the right to know what consequences they have to expect .

31931,"that is why I ask you to support my amendment , which I tabled together with"
31932,"firstly , we are preparing the new members for full , equal membership ."
31933,enlargement will not create a Europe à la carte or a two-tier society in the Union
31934,new members must meet all the conditions for membership .

31937,"Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports the rapporteur 's"
31938,it is therefore right that this European Parliament should take these reports seriously and examine once
31939,I was disappointed that some colleagues in the debate on the big issue of free
31940,"that is only a small part that needs to be discussed , but we should say goodbye"
31941,that cannot be the case !
31942,we should find a consensus by accepting that the different states have different ideas and regulations

31950,Turkey is the only country in Europe that must finally abolish the death penalty .
31951,a reform policy on the Kurdish question must not be delayed too long .
31952,"we are pleased with the report from Luxembourg today , but we must nevertheless say that"
31953,we are prepared to be patient with the pace of democratisation .
31954,"however , we do not accept a standstill on this particular issue ."
31955,"the amendments tabled to the Commission proposal complement it and , above all , place it"
31956,"when it comes to new programmes , especially in the fields of education , culture and youth"
31957,where will the money come from if we do not want to cut other similar programmes in the

31960,it is intended to provide equal opportunities for all disadvantaged people in the European Union

31962,it is intended to prevent exclusion from becoming part of everyday life .
31963,"it is intended to offer everyone the opportunity to benefit from a joint initiative , no matter"
31964,"that is my intention , and I ask the House to give this report a convincing vote of"

31978,I firmly believe that it is necessary to make every official who has to do with European
31979,no one should be allowed to hide behind the back of centralised financial control .
31980,you then asked about the revision of the European Works Council Directive .
31981,"yes , this is planned for 2002 and we have already begun to organis"
31982,"as regards your third question on mergers , we have to examine further whether and to what"
31983,the outcome of this examination is not yet final .
31984,one final comment : the permanent availability of sexual content in the exclusively anonymous private
31985,we cannot solve this with Interpol and tighter criminal law alone .
31986,the Internet – and child pornography is a clear example of this – poses completely new challenges
31987,we should discuss this at least as much as we discuss the tightening of criminal law .
31988,that is why my first question to the Commission is : is it prepared to set up an

31990,"it cannot be right that in a European single market , different VAT rates are applied in the"

31994,"overall , this action to combat the total falsification of documents by comparing what is not"
31995,but it would be necessary to try to achieve even greater efficiency here by not operating
31996,that is why we are now proposing a lawsuit regulation .
31997,"I hope that this report will be adopted by a large majority in this House tomorrow ,"
31998,it cannot be that after a few years we say :
31999,"unfortunately , it didn 't work ."
32000,"in the long term , we must be able to talk about coexistence and freedom of choice"
32001,the second question I would like to ask is this : your report is very optimistic that ten
32002,"I think you have expressed it , but it should have been expressed even more clearly"
32003,that is the assessment of today !
32004,"that is , if countries fall behind due to political failures next year , it could well be"
32005,"this , of course , involves the issue of implementation and the issue of administrative capacity ."
32006,"in your paper , you state that work on implementation will continue even after the signing ."
32007,"but what certainty is there , when the agreement is signed , that administrative capacity will really"
32008,what we must achieve now – and that was our great hope after the Kuwait crisis in 1
32009,we must seize this opportunity now .
32010,the credibility of our policy will also depend on whether we succeed in bringing about
32011,"I have some difficulties with another point , namely the question of the degressive nature"
32012,it is right that they must be degressive .
32013,what the Commission is proposing seems to me to be a little too schematic .
32014,I would recommend that the Council give some thought to whether it can not refer back to what the

32032,the most important point – as has already been said – is the inclusion of self-emplo

32034,a number of companies have quite clearly realised that excluding the self-employed means
32035,I would like to remind you of the consequences : if the 3.5 million
32036,it cannot be true that they accept that .
32037,equal treatment of women in science must also lead to a strengthening of women 's influence
32038,"research on women and gender should be considered as fundamental research , which is of enormous importance for"
32039,the Member States must develop new instruments to increase the untapped potential of all women in research and
32040,networks of women scientists must be supported and innovative projects promoted and disseminated
32041,"for example , in Spain and Italy , a higher number of women are found in the natural science"
32042,this needs to be examined in more detail .
32043,we adopted a guide for Member States on the adoption of sanctions and other measures
32044,we agreed on principles as proposals for the Commission to exercise implementing powers .
32045,we have drawn up a list of financial instruments to ensure the integration of new products into

32072,a lot has been said .
32073,I would just like to add three points in conclusion .
32074,communication also means information .
32075,I therefore appeal to the European Parliament and the Commission to involve all public representatives more close

32084,"Mr President , I would like to make one final comment ."
32085,we do not want the coordination of policies to be an end in itself .
32086,we have lost growth in Europe because we have not had coordination in the past decades .
32087,we lost because we did not coordinate the UMTS auction in Europe .
32088,we could have achieved quite different results !
32089,nor have we reacted together to the oil price increases by the OPEC countries .

32129,very long application procedures over many years simply lead to medium-sized enterprises

32144,I hope that we can put it into force as soon as possible .
32145,we have made our contribution to this .
32146,the new minimum amount of EUR 1 000 follows a proposal made by the
32147,most of the acquisitions in Europe are done below the threshold of EUR 4
32148,"however , there is no need for harmonisation below EUR 1 000,"
32149,"Mr President , I would like to explain that I voted in favour of the Paulsen"
32150,I am of the basic opinion that we must observe hygiene regulations very carefully and
32151,"it is , however , pointless for us to waste valuable materials , and food waste is"
32152,"I am pleased that the European Parliament has followed this path , albeit by a narrow"
32153,"I hope that , as we proceed , we will also receive the appropriate approval"
32154,there have been restructurings in the new Commission .
32155,"Europe Aid has been launched , and we expect that in future the programmes approved by"
32156,but at the same time we expect the Commission not to set up a new implementation organisation of
32157,"we want the political control of all these programmes to be in Europe , but we also want"
32158,I consider the discussion about what exactly is to be understood by the central role of
32159,"in a country which has no civil order at all , where the basic structures for a function"
32160,"the European Union should also be more involved in this area , and I also support the ECHO"
32161,I would therefore like to see a complete review of all the tankers currently sailing in
32162,"what happened with the Erika is not a matter of recklessness , but , in"
32163,"these are the port reception facilities , where the Member States are concerned ."
32164,"one thing is clear , however : when you are told in the Committee on Foreign Affairs or in"
32165,what we will not support - and I am saying this as a member of the budgetary authority
32166,we cannot allow two different people to do the same work in the same structures for the same
32167,that cannot be .
32168,"processing aid for long-fibre flax is , in fact , more expensive ."
32169,it must therefore be different from the aid for short flax and hemp fibres
32170,let me now turn briefly to the various expenditure areas that will be the subject of
32171,"as for agricultural expenditure , in October , as usual , the Commission will"
32172,"as regards the proposal to insure farmers against various risks , the Commission has commission"
32173,the Commission will then make its conclusions known and I hope to be able to report back to
32174,the European House was founded by our founding fathers as a house of solidarity .
32175,"even today , this solidarity is expressed , for example , in the support of structurally"
32176,the demand for more justice in the distribution of the burden of receiving refugees is there
32177,in the past – as has been pointed out here on several occasions – only a few

32179,"it has – as I have said – a long history , and it was last debated in"

32181,"above all , we are in complete agreement with Commissioner Vitorino , whom I would also like"
32182,"the cigarette industry is under an obligation to provide information and education , but products intended"
32183,you all know the headlines that come up when such conflicts escalate to the abduction
32184,laws cannot prevent people from fighting and suffering the consequences .
32185,but laws can help to limit suffering and prevent additional suffering from being caused by
32186,the pitfalls of the procedure alone can lead people to despair when it comes to
32187,the Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of decisions in matrimonial matters
32188,"it was certainly not a mobilization summit , as it was described in the press"
32189,"as far as the substance of the proposal is concerned , the interest of developing countries"
32190,"at the last session of our ACP-EU Assembly in Abuja , we learned that"
32191,"in this respect , the only strong advice that can be given to developing countries is to"
32192,"Madam President , I would like to ask that the results of the votes be displayed on"
32193,we now have a new voting system and perhaps it can be programmed to display the
32194,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are facing difficult decisions this week ."
32195,"control of the executive is a central right of Parliament , and budgetary control is its core ."
32196,"it is difficult , however , to grant discharge for a budget which was adopted two years"
32197,the death penalty is rejected by the vast majority not only in Europe but also in an increasing
32198,it must be abolished .
32199,the EPP Group calls on the European Commission to urgently reconsider all contracts with Pakistan
32200,we need cooperation agreements with human rights organisations and with regional NGOs .
32201,the ultimate goal of our initiatives must be to ensure that Pakistan finally finds the way back
32202,we also welcome the idea of creating an earmarked reserve in the agricultural sector
32203,the idea of creating a contingency reserve in view of the volatility of these markets
32204,I would add that the ad hoc procedure has increasingly proven itself as a constructive procedure between
32205,the concrete figures will be available in the autumn .
32206,"in this context , the Commission is encouraged by the positive message conveyed by the Dala"
32207,we hope that this was a first step towards establishing a more regular dialogue between Beijing and the
32208,the Commission will continue to focus on cooperation activities in Tibet which directly benefit the Tibetan people .
32209,I would like to note that a strange gradient is already emerging .
32210,on Tuesday and Wednesday we had considerable delays .
32211,question Time to the Commission started almost an hour and a half late and on Thursday the matter is
32212,"I would like to raise the question , and ask you to clarify this in the Bureau"
32213,"again , I hope that this report , if it is now adopted , will really help"
32214,I shall now turn to the amendments which are already covered by the proposal and which
32215,"these are Amendments Nos 2 , second part , 6 , 8,"
32216,the Commission has understood very well the reasons behind these amendments .
32217,"however , we believe that the general nature of the draft regulation is sufficient ."
32218,"in addition , some of these ideas will be reiterated in the implementing rules ."
32219,I therefore think it is good that the Commissioner has now considered measures to speed up this
32220,"it does good to this agency , which is doing an excellent job in Kosovo – I assume we"
32221,"we hope that this will be possible , that they will finally do what all the Macedonians are"
32222,"socially , the country is divided into a Muslim north and a Christian south , and this"
32223,the vast majority of the personal data stored in the current SIS relate to people who are
32224,the development of a second generation of the SIS does not only concern the upgrading of
32225,this fundamentally changes the character of the database .
32226,the second question - which was raised by the previous speakers - concerns the auction
32227,I can tell you quite clearly that there is no unambiguous consensus in my group
32228,I still believe that auctions are the most practical way of finding the most powerful and
32229,"the problem is , of course , that some Member States are going this way and others are going"
32230,this can certainly lead to distortions of competition .
32231,"if these become apparent , it is certainly up to the Commission to intervene ."
32232,we should learn the lessons and think about the future of treating everyone equally .
32233,"as regards access to documents for the discharge report , which is an important point , I"
32234,I can assure you that the Commission will fully adhere to this agreement .
32235,I should like to point out to Mrs Stauner – who has just raised certain issues
32236,I can tell you that the committee chairperson has not asked the Commission any questions on this matter
32237,the most recent events in particular show that the current government – and it is not the country of

32242,"I would even wish that even Mr Korakas might read it , because then he would come to"
32243,"as regards the question of the link with Turkey 's application for accession , the Commission"
32244,and the Commission has noted that the lack of a solution could become a serious obstacle
32245,"Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to use the short time"
32246,we are now increasingly committed to consumer information and education .
32247,the adult consumer should be informed about labelling and marking and should decide for himself what
32248,"strict , clear , unambiguous and understandable regulations must be adopted ."
32249,"names such as juice , fruit juice , nectar , fruit juice from concentrate or even"
32250,some believe that you can create a single market in Europe without agreeing on basic values and
32251,this opinion has never been supported by the majority of the European Parliament .
32252,"for example , in the case of the directive on the patentability of biotechnological"
32253,"this was an important step towards common values in Europe , especially in the field of modern genetic"
32254,"thirdly , the years 2003 and the following , which Mrs Jeggle also"
32255,the Commission has decided that any funds will only be used if the political situation in Serbia has changed
32256,"if this is the case , the Commission will decide how to respond to any need in the context"
32257,"I have been working in the Convention to make the Union more social , because a social Europe is"
32258,"in my view , this is precisely where the Union has the greatest need to catch up"
32259,"I am surprised when in my country , influential politicians claim that the draft"
32260,the situation is similar with primary law .
32261,"why are we , as Parliament , in this difficult situation ?"
32262,"because in 1976 , when the Act on direct elections was introduced , the"
32263,it was too hot for him !
32264,that is why the structure of the parliamentary assembly has continued into the directly elected European Parliament
32265,the purpose of this statute is to overcome this structure of a parliamentary assembly and become
32266,that is the purpose of the Statute !
32267,"we believe , Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Mr President of the Commission ,"
32268,we believe that we too should have a call back position if secondary legislation does not work
32269,we also believe that framework directives should have a kind of sunset clause .
32270,"unfortunately , this democratic control has not been replaced by democratic control by the"
32271,I am convinced that this is the crucial weakness of what was decided in Nice .
32272,breast implants fall within the scope of the Medical Devices Directive .
32273,I am very pleased that the Commission – as Commissioner Byrne has just explained – is

32276,I very much hope that the citizens of the accession countries will also take part in the elections

32278,"since 1957 , cooperation between independent nation states in Europe has developed dramatically"
32279,"like the gravity of a planet catches everything that approaches it , the courage of"
32280,"there is no end to this development , even if the reflection on Europe ’ s borders"
32281,"in addition to this central initiative for the 2001 budget , however , we"
32282,"this does not mean centralisation and unification , by no means , but on the contrary"
32283,"with the support of the regional cultural industry , we secure the economic basis and the development capacity"
32284,"I believe that the new method we now have , namely the parliamentarisation of the reform"
32285,"parliamentarians have the majority in the Convention , and we hope that this will also lead to"
32286,the balance sheet we have drawn since May 1999 does not necessarily speak

32299,competition rules will be the main instrument for regulating the electronic communications market .
32300,"however , until there is real competition in the market , there must be clear criteria for regulator"
32301,"I therefore very much welcome Mr Brunetta 's report , which proposes appropriate"
32302,"in my country , too , a process of reflection has begun , which , in addition to"
32303,we want full participation and no longer the exclusionary care of the past .
32304,"we want full equality and no more degrading compassion , and we want the right to"
32305,"of course , we need legal regulations for this ."
32306,I am surprised and incomprehensible at the Commission 's apparent willingness to

32308,"to this end , the external costs of insurance and the consequential costs of pollutant"
32309,we need non-discriminatory access to the grid for electricity and also for biogas
32310,this is a new idea that has been introduced here for the first time .
32311,"we need fair transit tariffs for all energy sources , and in a free market we also need"
32312,we owe this to our consumers .
32313,I would even go so far as to say that we should not limit this labelling to bill

32315,"we want allergenic fragrances that cause allergies in humans , which have been identifi"
32316,we do not want to ban them .
32317,we want them to be labelled and people who are allergic to them to be able to

32319,"all the groups in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy were very much in"
32320,"awareness must grow , and in order to grow , we need reports and discussion papers"
32321,we very much welcome the fact that we have made progress on the issue of the securities market
32322,"we also thank you for your commitment , but we say very clearly - and here we"
32323,"we will insist on this , and this is addressed to both sides , to the Council"

32326,"I would like to do that , but I am not allowed to !"
32327,your presidency is in a crucial phase for two other reasons .
32328,"with the start of the Convention , you will be able to set the decisive accents on"
32329,we therefore ask for your support in order to ensure that the Convention has the necessary working

32334,I think it is premature at the moment to automatically abolish unanimity – which is

32337,we have now tried to table amendments once again as compromise amendments .
32338,I hope that the Commission will now also accept these amendments .

32340,"we have been discussing this issue for five years now , and there is no point in having"
32341,"this matter is more than ripe for a decision , and I can only ask the House to"
32342,I therefore ask that this motion for referral back be rejected .
32343,let me just outline our content orientations today ;
32344,we will have an opportunity to discuss this in detail in November .
32345,our draft resolution will mainly contain the dynamic elements which have already been mentioned by
32346,intellectual property protection needs to be improved in many developing countries .

32353,this statement on cloning of embryos of the EP may represent a success in the short term
32354,"however , I fear that the completely uncritical demands for more medical genetic engineering will destroy"
32355,they could open the door even further for a technology whose consequences are not foreseeable
32356,"we must now , in fact , initiate a monitoring process in all areas , which will"
32357,we believe that we have created good conditions for this .
32358,"the Commission is particularly active in supporting non-governmental organisations in Slovakia ,"
32359,we still hope that the emerging compromise we are now proposing in Amendment No
32360,this means that misconduct is registered and documented .
32361,the authority of the exporting third country must give its explicit consent to the re-export
32362,"the next logical step , however , would be for the exporting third country to also document"
32363,"finally , I would like to point out that my colleague Chris Patten , who"

32369,"Mr President , I would like to begin by saying that Mrs Napoletano 's report is"

32372,"we also regret the use of these weapons , not least in Afghanistan ."
32373,but what is more crucial is to look to the future and that the European Union should be very
32374,Europe must also make a clear commitment to this .
32375,"Commissioner Schreyer , I would like to ask you if you can actually tell us which budget"
32376,is there actually an evaluation on the basis of which we can say which budget line we are
32377,is there any scientific work or documentation from DG IV that has dealt with this ?
32378,"if we have a budgetary procedure , can we see whether our main priority , which we"
32379,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
32380,I too wish to congratulate Mr Corbett .
32381,this is not a very simple matter .
32382,perhaps the best way to explain it – precisely because there are always some visitors here at
32383,it is also important to highlight the link between competition policy and consumer protection .
32384,I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in dialogue with
32385,greater transparency will also contribute to public acceptance of competition policy decisions .
32386,"then it will be clear that , for example , lower electricity and telecommunications prices"
32387,I would ask that we discuss this Commission proposal as quickly and as efficiently as possible in

32395,"for this reason , we are convinced that the death penalty in the Öcalan case is"
32396,"the Öcalan case could also be an opportunity for the people , for the Turks ,"
32397,but it is the case that every bad side has a good side .
32398,"in my country , Austria , a group of freight forwarders has already emerged ,"
32399,that is the situation we are facing .

32411,the Commission has so far failed to present a coherent overall plan for the Alpine region

32413,Mr Rothley is right that the text scratches the principle nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare

32535,I read in a newspaper today that the European Parliament would not consider the fight against AIDS to be

32539,"Madam President , I would like to start by saying that we have really done a lot of work"

32573,this shows the requirements that exist .
32574,"I would also like to thank you , Commissioner , for your ideas for the Barcelona Summit ."
32575,I already told my group of visitors from Bad Hersfeld this morning how committed you are
32576,"Parliament , and my group in particular , has strongly supported your agenda , but we are"

32587,"Mr President , I would like to withdraw the text in Amendment No 33"
32588,the rapporteur has been informed of this in advance .
32589,"we will need a sufficient number of adequately trained inspectors , and we will"
32590,the current Member States can make a great contribution to this goal .
32591,"Twinning , the temporary transfer of well-trained specialists from existing administrative and control"
32592,let us use this model again this time !
32593,I am convinced that this plan will jeopardise the Union 's objectives rather
32594,at least that was the opinion of the EU architects in 1996 .
32595,what Mr Provan said is correct .
32596,"I was here in plenary yesterday from 3 p.m. and we , Parliament"
32597,"all this combined , under Vice-Presidents Colom and Provan , meant that we"
32598,Parliament itself is to blame for the fact that we have overstayed .
32599,the Vice-Presidents have had a hard time and I think it is unfair that we
32600,we ourselves must change our agenda and be a little more disciplined !
32601,today 's vote brings us a good step closer to consumer protection in the European Union
32602,"Mr President , this is a matter of principle ."
32603,Mrs Villiers did not agree with our group on this either .
32604,"nevertheless , I agree with Mrs Villiers that this is an important report ."
32605,"but even if it is an important report , it can be voted on on Friday morning ."
32606,"many of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer"
32607,the common position is not a great achievement in terms of environmental policy either .

32619,why is Question Time to the Council being cut by half an hour again ?

32621,you know that I consider the right to ask questions to be a basic parliamentary right .
32622,I regret that this is happening more and more often !
32623,"the Commission has an important role to play here , by launching a policy of tax reduction"

32626,the European Union has been active in Paraguay for a number of years .
32627,our efforts to influence the situation in concrete terms are concentrated on two areas .
32628,"firstly , it is a question of developing and strengthening democratic institutions ."
32629,"Mr President , I believe that we have probably all failed to highlight the objectives ,"
32630,the President mentioned the International Criminal Court .
32631,"here , too , we have failed to convince the new Members that multilateral institutions"
32632,"that was a mistake , that was a failure ."
32633,perhaps it is also a revenge for the fact that we have sometimes taken an overly
32634,you will see from my comments that I think it is useful to discuss these proposals further in
32635,that is also your concern in the area of the Member States .
32636,I should like to point out that I will take your proposals as an opportunity to discuss them
32637,I will then gladly report back on the discussion in committee .
32638,I would like to ask how Mr Westendorp is legitimate to go around and say on
32639,I do not remember we having ever taken such a decision in plenary .
32640,"I would also ask that , in the trialogue with the Council tomorrow , we do"
32641,how is the Council expected to deal with the directive on the protection of financial interest
32642,"unfortunately , some Member States have already taken a clear position against this directive , for"
32643,you mentioned it .
32644,"all the Member States in the Council then say , yes , of course , we must do something"
32645,I would therefore like to see those Justice Ministers who are arguing in this way put
32646,no human being would understand that .
32647,"the public will not accept that either , that it is said that we cannot do anything here because"
32648,"how long will it take after 2005 before everything is really operational , if"
32649,"secondly , the Commissioner spoke of shifting transport from the road to the rail , where"
32650,"here , too , a number of European governments – including the Austrian government – are slow"
32651,the plans are good .
32652,but we also need to make available the appropriate financial resources to take appropriate preca
32653,I also know that in many countries the rail would have the capacity to transport even more good
32654,"( de ) Mr President , I was pleased that Mrs Stihler spoke and that the Socialist"
32655,"I was afraid that the group no longer exists , or that it has said goodbye"
32656,"I just want to ask , if you do not need your speaking time , is it possible"
32657,we would be very grateful for that .
32658,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , dear rapporteur , Commissioner !"
32659,"to put it briefly , I believe that a self-commitment by the automotiv"
32660,I hope that the European Union will be able to take the Mediterranean process further in Marseilles and
32661,"this is the Mediterranean around which the three great monotheistic religions , some of which are"
32662,we must succeed in re-establishing dialogue on this very basic basis .
32663,"I believe that the European Union has a special role to play here , because the states and people"
32664,I hope that the fact that this political influence is expected and that we are expected to

32668,I am glad that at least the European business community is naming its differences and not simply
32669,"we have the withdrawal from the ABM Treaty , we have unilateral declarations"
32670,"the problem in such cases is always that those who have headphones on can hear you ,"
32671,"I would ask the Commission , and I would ask you , Mr Byrne , to confirm that"
32672,this is important to be able to have studies in all forms .
32673,"I would like to ask you very earnestly , Mr President-in-Office , to"
32674,"this is certainly a point of criticism in connection with the financial protocol , which we will"
32675,"secondly , the dispute over the Beneš Decrees is essentially about the amne"
32676,it must not be a question of using history as an obstacle to enlargement .
32677,"the amnesty law , however , legitimizes the means of expulsion as an instrument of"
32678,"this is contrary to the ethical foundation of the Union , the principles of the European"
32679,"the Balkan conflict was about exactly the same thing , about ethno-ethnic cleansing"
32680,anyone who trivialises this conflict of values does Europe a disservice .
32681,"right and wrong are not divisible and not negotiable , neither in the past ,"
32682,the conclusion is therefore justified that since Helsinki there has been a greater momentum in
32683,I would not go much further in my assessment at the moment .
32684,the Union 's decision to open accession negotiations and to proceed swiftly
32685,"in any case , I do not see any reasonable alternative to this path and can therefore"
32686,"why are we now , in 2003 , proposing once again to integrate"
32687,"generally speaking , this has two reasons ."
32688,"firstly , the proposal is beneficial to all parties involved , especially to the receiving countries"
32689,"secondly , the Commission is convinced that now is the right time , the right opportunity ,"
32690,I now turn to our excellent rapporteur to say that I and my friends have to reject
32691,"Mr Palacio , Commissioner Palacio has rightly stated in her White Paper that we do not want"
32692,we want to see how we can reduce the number of road deaths and achieve greater road safety
32693,"but if there is no European legislation , what is the need for a new road safety agency"
32694,"I would say , let us ensure that the Maritime Agency , the Air Navigation Agency"
32695,but not another agency !
32696,"it is not a problem for tobacco growers , because tobacco growers will certainly"
32697,maybe it is best to stick to what I have been doing for 15 years -
32698,then the problem arises only to a very small extent .
32699,"in all efforts to bring about a change in agricultural policy , it must be borne"
32700,"in Luxembourg , we have a quality mark for such pork , which is becoming increasingly"
32701,"Mr Corbett , you are concerned about the reputation of the European Parliament , as you"
32702,"what you are really concerned about is the electoral campaign in Italy , and you want to help"
32703,I think it is particularly important that we catch up with the Americans in terms of development
32704,"again , it shows that American women already have much more access to the Internet ."
32705,they have even overtaken the men on a point-by-point basis .
32706,I believe that we still have a good chance of intervening here with our action plan .
32707,"I therefore ask that , in drawing up the action plan , special attention be paid to"
32708,"unfortunately , neither basic service nor universal service is defined ."
32709,and defining these tasks is so important in my eyes because otherwise the marginalized target
32710,the report only states how the undefined basic service is to be achieved : more free market
32711,you are right to say that the state does not provide the best possible access to information technologies .
32712,"but companies are much , much less interested in it ."
32713,"they want to train for the market alone , as the UNICE summit at the weekend"
32714,"Parliament has drawn up a model here , which was then also laid down in an agreement"
32715,this model is to be used to try to pre-finance certain administrative expenditure in
32716,"Mr President , I have already pointed out why only organic farms are being considered when it"
32717,it is very important to note that we must not use this measure to undermine the commitments
32718,as far as the cultivation of protein feed in the form of arable beans and for
32719,this investigation is ongoing .
32720,"this is too late for this growing year in any case , because an amendment to the"
32721,this means that only the next growing year is considered .
32722,"therefore , we still have time to carry out an appropriate investigation ."
32723,I believe that the dangers of green genetic engineering are often overestimated .
32724,"I also believe that the chances for medical applications are overestimated , that there is a"
32725,"I believe that there are opportunities and risks in both areas , and this is also stated"
32726,"now that we have good rules in the plant sector , we also need good common rules in the"
32727,there is still a lot to improve .
32728,I very much hope that in future the Commission will provide the European Parliament with a more thorough
32729,one more thing on the time factor : some of the wording in this report is unclear
32730,"Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European"
32731,"I am pleased that we have the opportunity to discuss this directive today , not so much"
32732,"in other words , we want to motivate industry to move to other products step by step and"
32733,"once again , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation ."
32734,I am sure that this report will find an overwhelming majority in this House !
32735,it is also necessary in this European Constitution to clearly define the division of tasks between
32736,"in this context , it is also important to respect and safeguard the lowest level of democracy"
32737,"we must not , as has already happened with several directives , have a combination of European and"
32738,we therefore propose that local self-government be enshrined in a future
32739,listen to me !
32740,I always listen to you !
32741,"we therefore said that , in order to have a large majority in this House and to remain"
32742,only on this basis do we support the idea of not dealing with the issue as an urgent
32743,that is our condition for it .
32744,"I would also like to highlight the rapprochement between Greece and Turkey , which took place short"
32745,I sincerely hope that the confidence created by the de-escalation between these two countries
32746,I am pleased that Parliament and the Commission are in full agreement on this eminently important
32747,I hope that many amendments will be tabled for the plenary session of the Convention
32748,"the Commission therefore welcomes the support of the European Parliament , which is very , very clear"
32749,"I congratulate you very much on this report , also in the knowledge of how much personal"
32750,"at the third ASEM summit in Seoul , it was already achieved that political aspects such"
32751,"it will come as no surprise to anyone that our Parliament , which has placed these values"
32752,"we now have two proposals , not two restrictive proposals , but two proposals which"
32753,"while the criminal trafficking gangs must be combated , the NGOs or the churches"
32754,the previous speaker referred to the Commission and all that it has to do .
32755,I would like to point out from my own experience of almost three years that there is not always
32756,"let me make one thing quite clear , and I would like to follow up on what Mr Tur"
32757,"if Parliament , if the Commission , Madam Vice-President , should find after a few years that"
32758,these two considerations are still in the room .
32759,it is now a question for market participants to prevent the legislator from having to take these steps
32760,"in this respect , I hope that the legislation will not only be adopted , but that"
32761,we are all aware that the Treaty has already failed to pass the first hurdle –
32762,the answer to such a referendum cannot be a simple “ go ahead ” .
32763,with the motto “ eyes closed and through ” we will suffer shipwreck and miss
32764,enlargement must not become the victim of growing alienation between the citizens of Europe and the European
32765,the response to the warning signal from Ireland is also – but not only – a question of proper
32766,perhaps the citizens of Europe are demanding a more fundamental and complex response .
32767,"there is , in my view , an intrinsic link between the debate on the future of"

32769,"we have achieved that there will now at last be comprehensive labelling , that consumer"
32770,"I think that this will lead industry to consider whether to use genetic engineering in future , because the"
32771,"however , it also means that we must continue to ensure that we now find a good regulation in"
32772,I was very concerned yesterday that the Commission did not answer my question about how this is
32773,"with the growing awareness that money is the main objective and engine of organised crime ,"
32774,"the Community 's finances are also being victimised by organised crime , as the Commission"
32775,this is at the expense of the European Community budget .
32776,"Member States protect their finances according to their laws , but the Communities do not have"
32777,"the Community budget must therefore be protected by directives , regulations and other measures ."
32778,"among the other amendments in the committee report , I would like to highlight in particular"
32779,it is clear that the delay in implementing all these steps did not occur overnight .
32780,it was foreseeable for the Commission at the beginning of the year that the deadlines set
32781,I therefore also wonder why Parliament was not informed of this development at an earlier stage
32782,"Mr President , we have welcomed in this House the installation or election of Mr Koštunica"
32783,"we also had him here in Parliament very soon , and we are now , of course , together"
32784,"in addition to the organisational prerequisite , the cooperation of the responsible institutions"
32785,there is no justification for threatening an innocent person .
32786,"fourthly , we have assessed the consequences of the cultivation of protein-rich"
32787,if set-aside land were used for the cultivation of products which would then compete with

32800,"if you have heard Mr Pirker say that the critics are turning against Austria , then"
32801,this is a shameful attitude !
32802,the pre-accession strategy for Turkey is showing first positive results .
32803,"the constitutional reform recently adopted by the Turkish Parliament is a step in the right direction ,"
32804,the Commission believes that it is now possible to further intensify the pre-accession strategy
32805,the focus will be on a more detailed review of Turkish legislation and its alignment
32806,"however , we are not yet at the point where we could propose to start the screening for Turkey"
32807,"in connection with the coping with the past , one thing should be noted :"
32808,"we are right to oppose collective condemnation , but we do not do the same to"
32809,"as has already been pointed out today , we are not accepting governments , we are"
32810,"in this case , the Czech people , and the integration of the Czech people into the European"

32813,we know that the whole European Union will also benefit if economic and social cohesion can be
32814,this evaluation must therefore be carried out and should be done in future before the spring

32817,if I now propose to this House that we make only minimal changes to the Council 's common

32819,"the planned financial aid , which is actually a technical procedure at first , is also political"
32820,"my home country , Austria , borders four candidate countries ."
32821,it is therefore particularly interested in the economic and political stabilization of Central and South-
32822,this stabilization cannot be achieved without a contribution from the individual .
32823,how much political and financial capital would a growing insecurity in Central and Eastern Europe cost ?
32824,how much would it cost us to stand by and watch ?
32825,"we must be committed to this , not only financially but also politically ."
32826,"that is why I believe it is important , if I may say this as a first sentence ,"
32827,we must recognise that there has been a great deal of progress in many areas –
32828,I think it is particularly good that in Naples we managed to make such progress in

32844,the merger of the Community control bodies will not only have a positive effect in terms of
32845,"at last , a sensible , truly useful measure at Union level ."
32846,how can we help the oyster and shellfish farmers ?
32847,the funds can be used for cleaning the oyster tanks .
32848,new equipment for oyster tanks can be purchased or damaged aquaculture equipment can be

32850,a general sales promotion campaign would also be conceivable .
32851,what is particularly regrettable – and Mr Imbeni has already mentioned this – is that
32852,"in my opinion , there is a considerable need for action in this area in the future ."
32853,"the public must be informed , but please not with funds directly available to ECHO ."
32854,we should continue to pursue the positive approaches and seek to inform the public by other

32859,"on the question of co-financing and participation at European level , the Commission has propose"
32860,"yes , please , what is that proposal ?"
32861,"you can withdraw that one , then you stay with the other one and take the other one"
32862,"if you do something , you have to proceed in the same way as Mr Garot has"
32863,"he has turned the Commission 's poor proposal into a sensible , counter-cyclical proposal"
32864,"that is why our group will vote in favour of this proposal , and I very much hope"
32865,"I am just curious , Mr Garot , what the decision-makers in the Council will"
32866,I don 't think he has a chance .

32870,I am grateful to the European Parliament for welcoming the fact that the resources for the
32871,"as the Court of Auditors states in its annual report , there would have been opportunities to do"
32872,this is a completely filthy cross-financing between the Berlin and Edinburgh packages .
32873,this does not mean that we do not have to continue to make enormous efforts to improve the

32883,whether a regulation is a purely professional rule must be determined on a case-by

32885,yesterday it was announced that the military budget in Russia will be increased by EUR 1 billion
32886,you know that Russia would already be insolvent today without IMF loans and without EU money
32887,"that is , we are paying for this brutal war ."
32888,we therefore have a great responsibility to use our political weight and the trade and cooperation
32889,"you know that Moscow has reactivated the pseudo-parliamentary council in Moscow ,"
32890,we must fight back against this !
32891,"however , in this directive we must not only look at organic farming , but I think"
32892,I would therefore like to support the amendments tabled by Robert Sturdy .

32900,I listened to him and hoped that what he said was right .
32901,he is obviously more optimistic than I am .
32902,I don 't really believe that crises are cleansing .
32903,"if crises were to have a cleansing effect , then there would be more in the mind"
32904,"once again , we are sitting and standing in this House at a time when we"
32905,that is the way it is .

32908,"I would also like to refer to Mr Wynn 's report , which the European Parliament adopte"
32909,I have now learned that the Court has found the place in its House from which the report
32910,there has also been a suspension here .
32911,"in this respect , the pressure of the European Parliament to clarify the leaks has been successful"
32912,it is also clear from the Commission communication that we are dealing in Europe essentially with low

32916,"Mr President-in-Office , we were particularly pleased to hear you say that the"
32917,we strongly support this .

32919,"if we know , for example , that the Conciliation Committee between Parliament and the Council is"
32920,"Mr President , there has been a small accident a moment ago ."
32921,"in connection with the report on seeds , the Commission has made a statement which is actually ap"
32922,it was about the positive list .
32923,it was in the Commission 's interest to say that .
32924,what we are now calling for in connection with the seeds report is in our interest .
32925,"I propose – and this is also in the interest of the Commission , Mr Fischler ,"
32926,then we have heard both and can vote accordingly .
32927,I therefore expect the Commission and the Council to show the same strong common political will as the
32928,"in conclusion , Mrs Miguélez Ramos , I can only agree with you once again ."
32929,"we all – the European Parliament , the Commission , the Council , the Member States and also the"
32930,your initiative is an important step towards achieving this goal .
32931,it is precisely for this purpose that we want to look at the possibilities on the ground
32932,"so we do not want to be satisfied with brain fantasies , but we want to"
32933,I believe that this is a fair way of proceeding .

32944,"I am also surprised that the Commission is also choosing the form of a regulation here ,"
32945,"in this White Paper , it wants to strengthen local self-government , and"
32946,that is why I ask : how can such a regulation implement the principle of European governance to

32948,this is a very important point and I very much welcome the fact that the two rapporteurs have

32964,"the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy is naturally interested in international development"
32965,I would like to mention a problem in this context which deserves special attention and which is
32966,I am referring to the widespread corruption in a large number of countries .
32967,"of course , I am aware of the specific socio-economic causes of corruption ."
32968,but we also see it where poor income conditions do not offer an easy explanation .

32994,"we are in solidarity with our Austrian friends , who have proven themselves to be good European"
32995,you have our full support !
32996,the European Parliament is well aware of the topicality and sensitivity of this issue .

32999,"it is a success that the European position , as proposed by the Commission in its consultation"

33002,biotechnology companies are the absolute flops on the stock exchange .
33003,we do not have products that are established and accepted by the market .
33004,for years we have been talking about this so-called genetic technology .
33005,"if you are serious about all this , you do not need an alibi for a food authority"
33006,"that is your task , Mr President-in-Office ."
33007,"I would be glad , Madam President , if this could be my last contribution in this context"
33008,"that is why the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , which is not"
33009,"I would like to clarify some of them once again , because we have not only discussed"

33026,it remains unclear how consistent the Commission has been in responding to Parliament 's
33027,the decisions taken so far by the Commission and the Council are therefore inconsistent and

33032,this can be ruinous for individual companies .
33033,the second aspect that played a role was the question of video interrogation .

33069,"the European Union , for its part , should also consider whether there are a number of possibilities"

33130,allow me to make one more comment .
33131,"I would like to take up what Mr Brok said about conflict prevention , but also about"
33132,we are helping each other .
33133,I would just like to remind you that the Japanese are using a lot of development aid
33134,the Commission can broadly agree with the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets
33135,"no , for a personal fact ."
33136,"I do not know what that means in German , but as Vice-President you should know that"
33137,I was personally attacked .
33138,"Mr President , I have been in parliament for 37 years now and I know what a"
33139,I would ask you to give me the floor to respond to this personal attack .
33140,I want to focus on the most important things :
33141,sea ports .
33142,Parliament would like to see 1.5 million tonnes of cargo and 200

33144,"this then leads to the situation , for example , that in my beloved Schleswig"
33145,Parliament cannot allow such a thing to pass !

33148,as to whether the Commission will take any initiatives to increase the availability of dialysis during

33151,"this has also required a very strong adjustment on the part of the accession countries , where"
33152,we hope that payments to farmers can then begin this year .
33153,I could have accepted all these restrictions as a compromise and I can accept them if the
33154,"however , the Council only wanted to accept a variant in which the decision is left to the Member"
33155,"this means , however , that the Council has not even come close to accepting any of Parliament"
33156,"this is hardly acceptable to me , and that is why I repeat : avoid the"
33157,"if the Council wants to play poker here , then we will play along , and that means"
33158,"otherwise , we have indeed almost only lost through the unofficial negotiations ,"
33159,I am also shadow rapporteur for Lithuania and here too I share the view of my fe
33160,"the reform process in Lithuania was not quite as consistent and stormy as in Estonia , especially"
33161,"a particular problem , both in the discussion with the EU and with the public , was the task"
33162,I believe that we are on a good path together .
33163,I just want to show how important this directive is .
33164,"in Austria alone , there are nine million passengers , who in 255"
33165,"the directive means a competitive advantage and increases the competitiveness of European , and especially"
33166,the directive ensures uniform safety standards for passengers .
33167,"it ensures that the free movement of goods , the internal market for the cable car industry"
33168,it strengthens the cable car industry as an important part of the national economy .

33171,"in this sense , it is important that in the future , the growth of gross domestic product will"
33172,growth in gross domestic product has nothing to do with sustainability .
33173,"in this sense , we call on the Commission to make a strong case in Johannesburg for new social"

33175,Caller location information should be clearly and transparently regulated where consumers wish it to
33176,it is absolutely necessary that there should also be transparency in terms of costs and that
33177,"therefore , equal conditions for all providers in this area ."
33178,"of course , the fight against harmful content is also important ."
33179,we should consider whether it would not be possible to carry out studies to determine who is actually
33180,"Mr President , the current Financial Regulation is outdated ."
33181,it no longer meets the requirements of modern financial management .
33182,"based on the principles of decentralised responsibility and transparency , the Commission has"
33183,"the two rapporteurs , Mr Dell 'Alba and Mr van Hulten , have worked through this"
33184,praise and appreciation for that !
33185,"the ecopoint system was in itself a compromise , dear friend Georg !"
33186,the Council 's New Year 's Eve decision was my very last chance to find a common

33188,another example that gives hope comes from Brazil .
33189,a student salary was introduced for 11 million children from the poorest families .

33191,examples like these few that I could put should be taught worldwide for the sake of

33193,it was not decided to introduce fees .
33194,what has also been lost here is the fact that the contributions to staff pensions are being

33196,"this is also the aim of my amendments , which were adopted by a large"
33197,our main concern is to add two more amines to the list of substances banned because
33198,"also , the general description of the scope of application is too non-binding ."
33199,"we want a clearly defined , exhaustive list , because this will create legal certain"

33201,"we have also provided for an option that , until new test methods are validated , two methods"
33202,"overall , the adoption of the amendments before us , which were approved by"
33203,it thus meets the requirements that must be made of it because of the actual health risk
33204,my last point is that I asked the Commissioner to say something about the seed regulation in the debate
33205,I am afraid that we as Parliament are being fooled .
33206,"I would ask the Commission to say something about this , because we as Parliament are not being consult"
33207,"will there be a zero threshold for seeds , as is already the case in some"
33208,so is it not technically inevitable ?
33209,I would ask you to answer this question .
33210,"secondly , the newly introduced balance sheet total limit of EUR 800 million"
33211,"until now , these credit institutions were completely excluded ."
33212,EUR 800 million is nothing !
33213,"in my former constituency of 70,000 inhabitants , the savings"
33214,it is not fair that we are creating a new access for the Commission .

33216,"with a view to Cyprus 's future membership of the European Union , it would be advi"
33217,"now , however , to the points that will be the focus of the consultation ."
33218,Mr Costa Neves has dealt with this in detail .
33219,let me say the following :
33220,"firstly , I believe that the Commission 's proposal to set aside EUR 1 billion"
33221,"we now have the first bills for foot-and-mouth disease on the table , and"
33222,"we should go for the safe side and , of course , we will then be able to say"
33223,how much do we have to pay from the budget for foot-and-mouth disease ?
33224,"but at the moment , I believe that the reserve proposal is the most appropriate one ,"
33225,after the European Union suspended trade facilitation and quite rightly blocked foreign capital in recent
33226,"in 2002 , San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest , there was a"
33227,"the EPP calls on the government of Burma to release the Nobel Prize winner , her fellow"
33228,persecution and murder must end immediately !
33229,"universities , schools and the offices of the League for Democracy must be reopened at"
33230,we also call for free elections under independent international observation .
33231,"if the military junta continues to refuse to take the urgently needed reform course ,"
33232,"the ASEAN countries , the United Nations and the international community must be called upon to do their duty"
33233,"secondly , it is very important that the chair of the Disciplinary Board be an external"
33234,this makes it clear that the Commission wants to conduct fair and objective disciplinary proceeding
33235,we believe that this relatively new institution is actually a huge step forward in terms of the
33236,"that is why we have very little understanding for the fact that the few wishes , especially in"
33237,I already have the feeling that in the past the Commission has underestimated the future costs of
33238,"ultimately , it is up to us as Parliament to distribute the scarce resources as fair"
33239,I think that is a very critical point .
33240,Members have presented their approaches from their areas - the small institutions - and I hope
33241,"however , the governments of the Member States and the European Parliament must deal with the fact"
33242,"Russia has not honoured its international commitments to Georgia , which it entered into in"
33243,I can only hope that in future Russia will support constructive negotiations in all parts of
33244,"Madam President , I would like to add something to this ."
33245,"it is normal that sometimes one wins , sometimes the other ."
33246,"but with such a serious concern , we need reasonable preparation ."
33247,"Mr Barón Crespo , last Thursday – you were not there , I do not blame"
33248,on such important issues it would be good if the House voted together .
33249,I would ask you to ensure that in future we discuss this first in the Conference of Presidents
33250,I would like to illustrate the importance of this institute in Latin America by giving one
33251,"only recently , a member of the Irela Supervisory Board , Celso Lafer ,"
33252,this shows how high profile we have had in our relations with Latin America in the past .
33253,"in response to Mrs Smet 's questions and comments , I fully share your view that women"
33254,this is not just any voluntary statement – although I am happy to make it voluntarily
33255,this is explicitly taken into account in many areas .
33256,"on the issue of human rights violations , especially violence against women , I would point out that"
33257,this will of course also be a guideline for all measures in the area of Category
33258,"Mrs Buitenweg asked about the staffing for the environment , also in preparation for the"
33259,"when you have completed your vote on the 2003 budget on Thursday , the"
33260,I would like to point out that we have different increase rates in agricultural policy .
33261,"firstly , as in recent years , according to the Commission 's proposal , the entire amount"
33262,"above all , this category also includes agricultural environmental measures and is therefore of"
33263,today we are talking about the first area .
33264,"under certain conditions , the general ban on cartel agreements is lifted , these are the so"
33265,Incompatibilities with the laws – even in areas where there are exemptions –
33266,exemptions under Article 81 ( 3 ) are only possible – and we should
33267,although the new action programme brings together and concentrates the various programmes in the youth field
33268,Parliament has already made it clear to the Commission that the balance between the various programmes must be
33269,this makes the new action programme much more clear and therefore more citizen-friendly than
33270,we are therefore faced with the situation that we have an economic area in which crime is

33272,"the tourism professions are therefore favoured by their quantity , but also by their"
33273,communication skills and creativity are trained .
33274,"Teamwork skills , awareness of responsibility and management know-how are achieved ."
33275,multilingualism and the ability to empathize with foreign cultures create a better understanding
33276,"all the more important is that stable foundations for a European orientation are created , of"
33277,"I believe that this includes qualifications , such as diplomas , which can be recognised"
33278,it is important to create the conditions for this1
33279,you can 't postpone it forever .
33280,you know that the ceiling is 1.27 % of gross domestic product within the financial
33281,where are we in reality ?
33282,at 1.06 % .
33283,that cannot be the implementation of real structural policy !
33284,this is also due to Parliament …
33285,let me conclude by saying that we are once again facing very demanding times for all
33286,I wish that we all have the energy and patience to respond to each other in order to
33287,I reject this because I ask that our work be seen as supporting the Commission .
33288,we have a common task to master for this Europe !
33289,we also believe that the market share of combined heat and power could be increased to 1
33290,combined heat and power can be operated with fossil energy just as well as with re
33291,"we are particularly focused on renewable energy , and there are positive examples of"
33292,"to give a concrete example , I believe that the Czech Republic should be able to assess the"
33293,"if we can win both sides over , we can really shape a new future ."
33294,"nevertheless , for the divided island of Cyprus , this pre-accession strategy as"
33295,"in my view , the European Union 's task is to use all instruments , including this one"
33296,"especially in the information technology sector , some European countries lack qualified workers , as Mr"
33297,better than their “ import ” from third countries are appropriate investments in voca

33299,"the most important objective of the summit must be achieved as quickly as possible , na"
33300,the Ciampi Group also mentions the statute of a European public limited company in this context
33301,it estimates that the lack of such a statute would result in an economic loss of
33302,we do not want the European company as such .
33303,"we need this European company , with minimum standards of employee participation ."
33304,"our social policy objective is not purely a market economy , but a social market economy as"
33305,"Madam President , our Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats has spoken"
33306,"I must say , Mr Barón Crespo , that I am very surprised that you are"
33307,you criticised me last week when I asked – for reasons we thought were understandable –
33308,you said that this contradicts the agreements .
33309,"well , I had to take note of that ."
33310,we agree with the legislative proposal as a bridging measure until the end of 2
33311,"however , the Deloitte [ amp ] Touche investigation reveals a number of serious"
33312,"business and user-friendliness became increasingly bureaucratic and cumbersome ,"
33313,"in conclusion , I would like to say that with this directive we are taking a proper and"
33314,let us therefore vote in favour of adopting the directive tomorrow .
33315,"above all , these things must be developed within a democratic framework and by democratic"
33316,"in the case of Macedonia , a democratic state , violence is not necessary , it is"
33317,"if this is clear and obvious to the Council and the Commission , then a number of questions"
33318,"Mr President-in-Office , this Parliament has the right to get answers to some questions"
33319,"you have said a great deal today , Mr Prodi , about the areas for which I"
33320,"these are the areas of environmental policy , consumer protection and health policy ."
33321,"for the first time today , I have not heard you give an economic lecture with only a few"
33322,"I rarely do that , and that is why I like to say it here ."
33323,"unlike other times , this was a speech that was really more concrete , and which I could"
33324,in order to estimate the expenditure that may arise for enlargement - the financial frame
33325,it should be quite clear to the populations of the Member States that enlargement is not a

33330,"the Commission proposal , whereby associations may only take action in court if the parties concerned"
33331,"associations , organisations and legal entities with a right of action should only be representatives"
33332,"in the latter area , in particular , I welcome the initiatives of health sector actors"

33334,"this creates inequalities for both the border worker and the local authorities , which"

33339,"but as always , when it comes to making justice for women in all situations , not only"
33340,the Commission will be guided in its proposal solely by the principles of negotiation
33341,there is no political pre-selection .
33342,the only criterion will be whether a country really fulfils the accession conditions or not
33343,"at the same time , the financial framework and all the related issues should be clear by the"
33344,I think it is an important message that the Italian Presidency has expressed the same thing and
33345,we must see that this draft Constitution represents significant progress in almost all areas .
33346,"while Nice only created the formal conditions for enlargement , this Constitution creates the decisive conditions"
33347,"more could certainly have been done , but I believe that progress is clearly visible ."
33348,"what is important is to send the right signal from here that we want accession , that it"
33349,we have a good overview of what Media I and Media II have created .
33350,"media plus can only get better , that 's what the "" plus "" behind it says ."
33351,I think that at a time when we are talking about extremely important things in the field of

33353,the Commission shares Parliament 's view that Kyrgyzstan has put its reputation at risk over the
33354,"the Commission has never failed , and will not fail this time , to stress the importance it"
33355,I would like to mention at least three reasons :
33356,"firstly , the high costs , which the European Parliament has repeatedly pointed out during"
33357,it is estimated that investments in the 15 Member States alone will amount to
33358,"for the candidate countries , the estimates for this one directive alone are currently around EUR"
33359,"however , I would also like to say that all this will only work if we are also prepare"
33360,"we will not succeed in the field of prevention and civilian crisis management , we will"
33361,prevention often only works if you can show the country in which you want to intervene to bring
33362,the mere fact that one possesses military possibilities – all historical experience shows this – often prevent
33363,that is why the realization of the idea of having a rapid intervention force of 6

33366,it is used to create the Natura 2000 network - which is also a measure
33367,"after completing the investigation , the European Prosecutor will bring the case before the"
33368,"the court proceedings themselves , including the judgment , should be conducted in accord"
33369,the Commission proposes a decentralised structure for the prosecution service .
33370,"the European Prosecutor 's Office will rely on so-called "" deleg"
33371,"Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me start by pointing out once"
33372,the fact that we now have a stable euro for the entire euro area is not only a
33373,I would also like to stress that the Commission is pursuing a strategy to promote food security
33374,your resolutions on the conservation of stocks and on fisheries management are in line
33375,we need multiannual and tailor-made approaches to fisheries management .
33376,these concepts must be adapted to the specific fisheries and fishing activities and to
33377,these approaches must also ensure that discards are reduced to a minimum .
33378,"cooperation with other Community programmes must be further promoted , because there cannot be any parallel"
33379,the Commission 's follow-up reports should also take account of the follow-up report
33380,what is important to us is what has come out of these programs .
33381,"what impact do they have on teacher training , for example ?"
33382,what positive experiences can the pupils or students take with them ?
33383,all this is important in order to continue the programme or to be able to refine it .
33384,I believe that we have the right to expect results .
33385,"it would be more than cynical , however , not to point out that the structural adjust"
33386,one point that is very important to me is the involvement of women when contraception programmes
33387,women – and this is nothing new – are particularly exposed to poverty .
33388,but the rates of HIV / AIDS infection in southern Africa also show that women are far
33389,there is consensus in this House on the seven objectives of the year .
33390,"the programme aims to promote cooperation between educational institutions and sports organisations , social competence"
33391,"lastly , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Byrne , we need control ."
33392,"it is also your task , the task of the Commission , to convey to the Member States"
33393,"if we want to continue to guarantee safe food , perhaps even more safety , if we want"
33394,then the new Food Safety Authority will be a step forward for the European Union .
33395,"I ask you , Commissioner , to ensure that this will be the case ."
33396,I will use an example from the country in which I was elected to show that I do
33397,"in the Federal Republic of Germany , for example , there has been a legal proposal according to which"
33398,"a year ago , however , this was not applied to hooligans , but to demonstrators"
33399,some of those who initially approved this law have then said in the media that they did
33400,"they would have only approved the law at the time , because they assumed that it really"
33401,the tragic fact is that those affected today most likely contracted the disease in the mid
33402,"the risk of contracting BSE in Europe today is much lower , very low , but there"
33403,why do we demand this ?
33404,because we need to ensure the competitiveness of biofuels vis-à-vis mineral oil
33405,"currently , the additional costs are about 0.30 euros per liter ."
33406,a second reason is that biofuels are CO2 neutral and therefore make a significant contribu
33407,"thirdly , they are an improvement towards an independent European energy supply , which we have made our"
33408,"fourthly , biofuels are an indigenous resource of energy and the EU , just"
33409,"with today ’ s step , we are therefore taking a conscious step towards strengthening the"
33410,I therefore request that the vote on the Pirker and Giannakou reports and the

33412,"however , if you listened carefully to the young people , you would find that , in"
33413,"nevertheless , the Commission could have done more , I would even say it should have done"
33414,it is creeping behind the Council like a snail in order to put its agreement on the
33415,"the Commission 's role is also to be the engine of integration , but at least it"
33416,I do not believe that it has done so with this proposal .
33417,I do not want to exempt ourselves as Parliament from a certain degree of self
33418,we too could have been more courageous in our demands for a reform of the own
33419,"it is about refugees , in particular politically persecuted persons , and those who need"
33420,"there is nothing unjustified in principle in this regard , as far as the care and benefits"
33421,"on the contrary , we do not want people on the run to be treated differently"
33422,but we are concerned that there must be a defining distinction between someone who is political
33423,"in order to avoid excessive administrative burdens , we are right to call for the responsibility"
33424,of particular importance here is also the fact that we have fortunately managed to find a

33426,"so far , you can only drive 20 kilometres , which corresponds to a"
33427,that is too little in view of the many groups that travel hundreds of kilometres .
33428,I ask you to take appropriate steps .
33429,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to thank Mrs Giannakou"
33430,this is also a very important report .
33431,it is therefore the duty of the European Union to provide massive humanitarian aid on

33433,"the Commission cannot and must not ignore this , and I therefore find it completely incom"
33434,"in my opinion , the Commission paper before us is therefore an unworkable approach to the"
33435,a new regulation must take into account all types of alcohol .
33436,"there cannot and must not be partial solutions , which in turn lead to imbalances ."
33437,the area of patient information and education must be decisively expanded in other contexts as

33443,"for despite all the childhood ills , which are quite natural , it is a wonderful"
33444,there is therefore much to say for tourism as an engine for employment and integration .
33445,it is the best way to make it clear that the world is ultimately a global village .
33446,"we are very much in favour of the freedom of choice of European citizens , but then let"
33447,"subsidiarity , in the sense of Catholic social doctrine , means that we must actually"
33448,we must discuss how we can regulate the participatory rights of insured persons and

33465,that ’ s how all these things came about .

33474,our relations have progressed well since Helsinki .
33475,the pre-accession strategy is being implemented .
33476,"as with all other candidate countries , the priorities for Turkey are set out in an Accession"
33477,"this year , Turkey adopted a national programme for adopting the acquis , which also includes the"
33478,this legislation must be in line with the European Union acquis .
33479,but we also call on the Commission to take into account the consequences of its initiatives .
33480,"for example , in the case of family reunification , we have the impression that you want"
33481,"we ask you to reduce family reunification to its core , so that we do not have"
33482,asylum and immigration policy must be an important area in general .
33483,"Mrs Corbey , you are right to say that packaging waste is increasing , and that is"
33484,I only think that we need to discuss here first what the Member States have actually done .
33485,"was the old packaging regulation from the 1990s right , or did we"
33486,have we really seen how it has developed today ?
33487,Aren ’ t there a lot of gaps ?

33493,the Court of Auditors also found that the relevant financial rules were not complied with .
33494,"my question was not about all that you have said , but it was very specific ."
33495,I am sorry - perhaps it is customary in Greece to prepare so badly for answer
33496,I would like to ask you the question again :
33497,"given the accession date of January 2004 , is the Council aware that"
33498,did the Council take this into account when it set the date ?
33499,I should like to point out that the Commission 's proposal is accompanied by a

33501,"I would also like to thank the Commission very warmly for making the proposals so quickly ,"
33502,"I really hope that we will vote in favour of this report tomorrow , so that the"
33503,"the Commission and Parliament have then done their job , and I really hope that the Council will take"
33504,now to the Commission .
33505,"we have seen with surprise , and the term has been used more frequently in our group ,"
33506,the big ones thought they could put pressure on the smaller countries to agree to no longer

33508,but I warn us :

33510,"when my colleague Daniel Cohn-Bendit visited Leyla Zana , she"
33511,"in this sense , we will continue to support the Helsinki process ."
33512,a lot has already been said about budgetary law .

33524,we have a new Commission .
33525,"whether we will agree with the work of this Commission , of the President of the Commission ,"
33526,"there is one thing we will certainly not be able to let them through , and you will"
33527,it cannot be the case that what is really important is regulated in annexes .
33528,that belongs in the legislative text .

33530,but you must understand that we will not let you pass this .
33531,"that means that whenever I can influence the situation , I will take everything out of the anne"
33532,so it ’ s best to do this right from the start !

33539,"I do not want to justify the Croatian extremists in Mostar , but they are of"
33540,"we have a huge problem to deal with here , because this is not an equal"
33541,we will not allow a new division of Europe .
33542,"we do not want the ideological demarcation lines , materialised in insurmountable"
33543,it is more than that .
33544,it is about extending peace and stability to the whole of Europe .
33545,but not just any stability .

33547,this is also due to the fact that women who are now retired were only legally en

33557,"I am also annoyed that , in the discussion in the Member States on national eco-ta"
33558,and that is why I have tabled an motion on behalf of the EPP Group
33559,we have the opportunity to correct the mistakes made at national level and to send a positive signal
33560,"Mr President , I dreamed that Mr Fatuzzo 's daughter had called my son , who"

33575,"we also have problems in the other categories , for example Category 3 , which includes the"
33576,"there too , it is very tight because we are describing more and more tasks but are"
33577,"we are transferring tasks from national to European level , expressis verbis , but then"
33578,that cannot be serious politics .
33579,we need to discuss this .
33580,"nevertheless , we will not make any effort to increase the funds within this category ."
33581,"security aspects will be secured in this civilian project , also a fear of the United"
33582,"the civil nature of the Galileo project , but also the public control , will prevent disruption"

33599,"however , when it comes to common interests in the social field , when it comes to common"
33600,it would certainly be useful if we could show the same speed in the social and cultural field
33601,Members of this House have already spoken at length about the need for and importance of action
33602,what exactly does this mean ?
33603,let us assume that a case has been concluded and a judgment has been handed
33604,"since the Court of Justice , unlike other Community institutions , does not publish its decisions until"
33605,I think that is an unacceptable situation .
33606,"this is also increasingly problematic for the courts of the Member States , because in preliminar"

33608,that is why we are fighting to ensure that the appropriate funds are made available to

33610,"you mentioned a seminar on the 20th and 21st , which is"
33611,"are parliamentarians also invited to take part , as Portugal has done exemplarily , where"
33612,"after Mr Jospin 's remarks , allow me , as an Austrian , to ask"

33617,"for me , the most important point is to contribute to the safety of nuclear power plants and"
33618,the citizens of Europe can demand that the safety of nuclear power plants also meet the highest standard
33619,"the strict Western European rules , which are ambitious in the Member States but not harmonised"
33620,I am convinced that this is an opportunity for the young people in Europe and that it is
33621,"this in turn educates us to be in solidarity with people who are different , who have"
33622,this brings us to the topic of youth .
33623,"I believe that we should also convey this entrepreneurial spirit , this joy of innovation"
33624,it is nice to see young people participate in research projects .
33625,"perhaps it would also be useful to run a Leonardo for researchers , an exchange programme between"

33633,I am not here to elaborate on the advantages that the next step in liberalisation
33634,the other Members will do that .
33635,"I am concerned about pointing out the shortcomings of the past , our inability"
33636,"that is why we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are , of course ,"
33637,"this is of particular importance in poorer countries , countries with a poorer approach to democracy ."
33638,"we want free world trade to be linked to the basic issues of future politics , our future"
33639,we do not want to advocate new protectionism - absolutely not - but we want workers
33640,this report will form the basis for a draft directive .
33641,our group has two requirements for the framework regulation for digital TV .
33642,the first is that the framework must not restrict the rapid technological development in this area
33643,I cannot imagine what interest you should have in putting something awkward on the way .
33644,"discrimination must be combated in advance , if it leads to intimidation ,"
33645,all stakeholders must be involved .
33646,human resources can only be fully exploited when there is peace of mind .
33647,it is an economic and social asset .

33675,"there were , of course , different views within my group , the Group of the European People'"
33676,our line is to aim for realistic goals and practicable solutions .

33683,"Mr President , I think that after the debate we had yesterday with Commissioner Diamantopoulou"

33687,annex II : it is about determining which electricity in a cogeneration plant is really
33688,this definition is climate zone independent .
33689,there can only be one definition and that definition must be valid throughout Europe .

33696,"against this background , we expressly welcome the European Commission ’ s decision to initiate in"
33697,"I would just like to point out that , this time too , the famous telephone calls between"
33698,perhaps this is also due to the fact that we have put this oral question on Parliament ’
33699,this is in principle to be welcomed .
33700,"Madam President , I too have found the debate quite ghostly at times ."
33701,"it is perhaps no coincidence that no one is here from the Conservative Party , because"
33702,if we continue to follow this path - and that is the ideology - of declaring the

33704,"that is why we must take care of this country , but very carefully ."
33705,President Bouteflika has taken steps towards opening up .
33706,he has taken steps towards reform .
33707,"a few weeks ago he organized a great ceremony in honour of Saint Augustine ,"
33708,but he wanted to make it clear that Saint Augustine had his roots in Algeria today .
33709,he also wanted to tell his people that they are culturally connected as Algerians with Europe

33711,they are important .

33714,my final point concerns disarmament .
33715,"there are other things that need to be disarmament , such as weapons of mass"
33716,our budget provides about EUR 100 million each year for the disarmament of chemical
33717,I would like you to report to us on this and we should have a debate or a statement
33718,"after all , it is a lot of money and , above all , a very topical issue"
33719,that is the only weakness of the White Paper on food safety .
33720,"questions remain open , such as : what relationship will the Food Authority establish with consumers ?"
33721,how will the funding be organised and how will cooperation with the Member States be organis
33722,what is the liability ?
33723,"so far , the innocent have paid ."
33724,the Commission will have to answer these questions more specifically in its further work .
33725,thirdly – and this has been a major concern for me as a member of the Committee on
33726,"we , as the European Union , are now spending a great deal of money , and"

33733,I must say that I too am very grateful for the cooperation with the Secretary-
33734,the second question that will arise is that of a target date for the conclusion of negoti

33737,I therefore very much hope that a date will be set in December .
33738,my personal opinion is that we should fix it in December .
33739,this would be an enormously important signal for the further dynamics of the reform process and the

33746,the President has given me speaking time insofar as he has already listed the profession
33747,"why have we been so careful about this report , going all the way to a time-"
33748,why did we insist on this conciliation procedure with a large and broad majority ?
33749,there are three main reasons for this .

33756,that is my main criticism of you .
33757,it may well be that Nice makes the EU arithmetically capable of enlargement .
33758,but the historic failure of Nice is that behind its decisions there is no vision for a Union
33759,"it is this spirit , the spirit of Monnet , Schuman and others , which was missing"

33836,I call on you to live up to your responsibility and stop this war .
33837,"I would like to thank Mr Leinen , who has worked very hard , and I can say"
33838,I would therefore like to ask all those who still have doubts to help us so that
33839,"unfortunately , the Union 's policy is contradictory ."
33840,"on the one hand , we are fighting for health protection – including through this directive –"
33841,the Union must set itself the objective of making its policies understandable .
33842,it will hardly be able to explain this contradiction to the citizens .
33843,the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is supporting dubious nuclear projects in Rov
33844,we know that the European Parliament has spoken out against this because it does not believe that these
33845,we also know that they are being built solely for the export of cheap electricity to Western Europe

33847,I would like to ask the President how it is that the Development Bank is nevertheless transfer
33848,we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are also in favour of a budget
33849,I am therefore pleased and would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow Member

33851,the introduction of the euro on 1 January will affect all citizens living in the European home market

33853,my personal opinion is that this is not a wise proposal and that it would be better to

33857,"anyone who really gets to know and understand the countries , the people of Europe through personal"

33868,I also think that the four strategic objectives are very well chosen and that the method

33873,"in other contexts , this is referred to as a “ lazy change ” ."
33874,"in its preliminary draft budget in June , the Commission not only tried to secure the"
33875,it was then that it made the logical proposal to revise heading 4 .
33876,"in 2000 , approximately 3 million tonnes of meat"
33877,"of this , about half a million tonnes were exported to third countries and about another half"
33878,the remaining 2 million tonnes were used as pig and poultry feed .
33879,"the Council decision of 4 December last year banned the use of such feed , such animal"
33880,"until then , it was known to be forbidden only for ruminants ."
33881,I would like to take this opportunity to thank once again all those involved in the negotiations

33889,are there any other companies affected beyond the Airbus consortium and Thomson ?
33890,"what will the Council and the Commission do , and how will they deal with those Member States"
33891,how will the Commission and the Council react to the American reply that has been read out
33892,"the proposal for a regulation which we have before us is intended to solve this problem ,"
33893,this is therefore a specific and temporary change in the allocation of quotas .
33894,it is intended to solve a specific problem that has arisen in one Member State .
33895,"however , independently of this change , the Commission will undertake a comprehensive review of"
33896,the Commission will submit the results of this examination to the Council during the year 20

33902,this has been the responsibility of the Commission .
33903,"as Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I would like to expressly thank"
33904,this is a joint success .
33905,now we must also reach a successful conclusion at the next Intergovernmental Conference and the next

33927,equality between men and women has not been achieved in the field of work or social protection
33928,the unemployment rate is considerably higher for women than for men .
33929,women still have difficulty accessing jobs and are far more likely to be in precarious and
33930,women 's wages are still far below those of men .
33931,"this results in little or no social protection , as the systems in force are based on paid work"
33932,we should remember why the Nice Conference was held .
33933,it should strengthen the European Union 's capacity to act for enlargement and at the same

33937,this can only be the Convention in which the national parliaments and the European Parliament are properly

33944,I really lack any understanding for this .
33945,I should also like to emphasise the fact that the national insurance supervisory authorities are
33946,this preventive supervision is also included in the Basel II document .
33947,this document was proposed by the Basel Committee of the Bank for International Settlements for banking
33948,"Mr President , I am speaking on a point of order , of course ."
33949,I thank the Commission for the statement .
33950,I would like to expressly support her in her position .
33951,she can be sure that she has the large majority of Parliament behind her .
33952,"let me say something in conclusion , however , so that there is no misunderstanding ."
33953,"bankruptcies of insurance companies are rather an exception throughout Europe , as they are subject to very"
33954,"however , the lack of an EU legal framework poses a potential risk and could lead"
33955,the idea and the need for a directive are therefore justified and the result is to

33959,this is a problem that exists and it would completely disrupt all existing policies .
33960,"this paragraph 12 is in no way contrary to paragraph 13 , because paragraph"

33962,"on the contrary , this could mean important steps for the future , for this new market and"
33963,that is why the Greens voted in favour .
33964,this also makes it clear that we are all called upon to discuss and initiate the introduction

33968,the economic system of the Treaty of Rome has proved itself to be the basis for economic

33970,"in some Member States , a term has become established for this system ."
33971,it is called the “ social market economy ” .
33972,I would recommend that this concept of the social market economy be included in the Treaty .
33973,that is also the opinion of the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial
33974,"we must therefore continue on this path , firstly by continuing to reduce public debt"
33975,we are still indebted for the sake of debt in most countries .
33976,"this means selling out the future , especially for the younger generations ."
33977,we need more room for manoeuvre for the necessary investments for the future .

33983,the result is before us .
33984,the fact that paternity protection cannot be equal to maternity protection was already discussed
33985,"thus , the compromise now leaves the freedom of the Member States to recognise"
33986,both mothers and fathers must have the opportunity to devote themselves to the tasks of
33987,this is certainly – contrary to the opinion expressed here – the declared objective
33988,"Madam President , as has already been said , the death sentences in question have absolutely nothing"
33989,but this also shows the responsibility we have to fight this fight .
33990,"the United States also has this responsibility within the framework of international institutions , the United Nations"
33991,"thirdly , on behalf of the PPE , I reject the report because we do"
33992,these range from the extension of the right of asylum to access to education and health for illegal
33993,"finally , we strongly reject the report because it calls for the right to adopt children"
33994,one can take the attitude one wants to have toward this partnership : I tolerate
33995,I would also like to make a comment on the time factor .
33996,"I did not understand Vice-President Marín 's rebuke , but he may see things"
33997,why am I in favour of giving the Commission time – but not too much time ?
33998,"we must finally get to the important issues : strengthening the Union , enlarging the Union"
33999,we must also get rid of the fact that for too many citizens the European Union is associated
34000,it is not that way !
34001,but we must also prove this by making corrections where there are errors .
34002,my question to Commissioner Kinnock therefore concerns the timetable .
34003,"yes to enough time to initiate reforms , but also yes to taking the essential steps"
34004,we must make clear decisions on this .
34005,"in so doing , he has trampled on Parliament 's budgetary rights ."
34006,"at the same time , it is forcing Parliament to choose between fighting for its rights and"
34007,"by acting in this way , the Council has broken the bond of loyal cooperation ."
34008,"after the many complaints I hear , for example in my constituency and beyond , about the paper"
34009,"I am open to a refutation , but this is a question that we have to clarify"
34010,"finally , the third point : enlargement ."
34011,"we agree on this point : enlargement is a moral , historical and political obligation for us"
34012,"the Council 's amendments , which extend the scope of the money , cannot be"
34013,we need electronic money that is valid in a specific environment .
34014,it must therefore concern the whole European area of application and not just a national one .
34015,I also think that the institutions issuing electronic money should be treated equally .
34016,it is certainly also important to think about the role of the European Central Bank – monetary
34017,but I am also thinking of consumers above all else .
34018,if e-money can also be used without restrictions on the Internet and for mobile phones
34019,I cannot therefore agree with the new wording in Article 8 ( c ) .
34020,I think we must do everything we can to ensure that consumer confidence is strengthened in the

34033,sport is movement !

34035,this includes freedom and also includes financial security .
34036,"thirdly , it makes sense to speak with one voice , despite the diversity of delega"
34037,I am very pleased with the Commission 's attitude .

34047,I firmly believe that the health of European consumers can be protected in the most sensible way

34049,"however , we want to take into account in these analyses the possible effects of the US Farm"
34050,"therefore , the submission of our mid-term review will take place on 10"
34051,this will also give us the opportunity to consider the comments you have made in your reports and

34055,"but unfortunately , this meeting was also completely unsuccessful ."
34056,"I would like to add the following to what Commissioner Fischler has said , particularly on"
34057,"firstly , I think it is right that decisions on concrete reconstruction , especially in Kosovo"
34058,"this is a line that this Parliament has advocated , which we have advocated : decentral"
34059,"nevertheless , and here I would perhaps like to go a little further than you ,"
34060,"this cannot be done in Pristina alone , given the infrastructure and the political situation ."
34061,"maybe I missed these words , maybe I didn 't hear them or read them ."
34062,I ask you to make the position of this House on these statements very clear .
34063,this is a Parliament that has always been in favour of dialogue and has always conducted dialogue
34064,our entire existence as a Parliament is linked to the dialogue between religions and cultures
34065,now to the structural funds .
34066,I would like to start by clarifying something .
34067,"it is not the case , as is repeatedly claimed , that the Commission is in"
34068,the fact is that if the Council does not reach a compromise in December and decide on the
34069,that is the legal consequence of the Council 's decision of December last year .
34070,I therefore recommend that the Commission proposals for financial aid be approved with the a
34071,my amendments to the Commission document recall the purpose of macroeconomic stabilization .
34072,the main objective must be to secure jobs in the long term and to improve the living
34073,the IMF 's economic structural adjustment policy is often the cause of the necessary

34075,"the Commission has learned from the mistakes of the past , which simply means saying clearly"
34076,"the Commission cannot throw magic , the Commission can only set itself the objective of doing good"
34077,"what Mr Savary emphasises is also very important , namely that , in the course"
34078,"Mr President , as far as the Presidency of the Council is concerned , I am one"
34079,we have all worked very well together with you – and of course Commissioner Vitorino too – and
34080,"but when it comes to Eurodac , we have a problem ."
34081,"I can speak for my party , which was a champion of Austria 's accession to the"
34082,"as a political force , we are the guarantee that Austria will remain committed to European values"
34083,I refuse to be put in a corner here for domestic and party political reasons !
34084,"this is not true , but pure polemics !"
34085,I strongly reject this .
34086,"Mr President , let us take up the initiative of our colleague Mr Bushill-"
34087,"the more accurate the information , the more confidence will be in initiatives from Europe ."
34088,the German path is no guarantee that this radical movement will not regain strength .
34089,"it cannot be transferred arbitrarily , because each Member State has its own conditions ."
34090,"the ÖVP ( Austrian People ’ s Party ) , which is no longer to be imagined"
34091,it can only succeed if agreements are reached that are necessarily based on respect for basic
34092,"Mr President , I am happy to answer that ."
34093,"as I have said , the Commission commissioned a study in 2000 to examine"
34094,we therefore decided - and this was a proposal by the Prodi Commission for the Financial Regulation
34095,"in June 2001 , the Commission services also prepared an initial package of measure"
34096,"that was the basis for the appointment of the accountant in January 2002,"
34097,we strongly support the innovative approach of establishing international development partnerships and organising exchange
34098,the specific objective of achieving a European value brings regional cooperation to the European level
34099,this is a good thing and that is why we have supported it .
34100,"secondly , another request concerns the increase in the flexibility reserves with regard to"

34102,"as you know , we in Parliament – and in particular we in the Committee on Industry , Ex"

34106,"there should be an opening , with the exception of the areas of ‘ change of competences ’"

34111,"Mr President , I think that there must be a possibility for someone else to say that"
34112,this opportunity must be given if another group withdraws the motion .
34113,that is what it was all about !
34114,if Parliament approves the proposal of the Committee on Budgetary Control this week and grants dis
34115,I think that the third part of Mrs van der Laan 's report is the most important
34116,the conditions contained therein under eight headings are an integral part of the discharge
34117,this would underline and guarantee that equal opportunities are taken seriously and that the programmes

34119,if equal opportunities are not systematically integrated into all phases of programme planning and

34124,this is a state that is highly intolerable .
34125,"in voting for discharge despite all this , I did not want to allow the scenario"

34127,"there is not much time until the next discharge , which we will begin in November ."
34128,"we will demand positive results by then , otherwise all the accusations will return under stricter"
34129,"the points are as follows : the Eurostat procedure is not yet completed , although"
34130,this will then be discussed in a hearing .
34131,a corresponding motion is being tabled today in an extended form .
34132,I ask for your approval .
34133,we believed that the most appropriate procedure was to have a dispute resolution body independent

34135,"we have recently had the European Transparency Initiative , which was set up to give as many"
34136,now we will see which documents really exist and which are sensitive ?
34137,what is sensitivity ?
34138,we are all very sensitive .
34139,how will you interpret the sensitivity ?
34140,"you will say , you can look at the car , but the engine is sensitive , the"
34141,or are we going to get there ?
34142,I think that one can be hopeful if one takes the example of the United States .
34143,"freedom of Information Act – it took decades to pass it , and that also started with a"
34144,"but please , Presidents-in-Office of the Council , including those of the future ,"
34145,there is money for that .
34146,"in the United States , the Freedom of Information Act costs $ 40 million each year ."
34147,the public relations of the American government costs 1.5 billion US dollars .
34148,I would therefore recommend that the Finnish Presidency gently put the Council document on the record
34149,we will not go into a Babylonian captivity of the Council .
34150,we will uphold Parliament 's autonomy and we will reject any kind of tutor
34151,today 's debate is intended to be the European Parliament 's contribution to these efforts
34152,"finally , I agree with you on one point , namely , the qualification :"
34153,it is indeed a shortcoming that Germany has to bring in experts from Asia and India .
34154,"we should have used this qualification , these opportunities for training for years !"
34155,but the last 16 years in Germany unfortunately slept on this point !
34156,the good thing about this dossier is that the amendment to draft No 8 has

34158,"in doing so , however , the Council has finally accepted that codecision is also necessary for"

34165,around EUR 100 million has been allocated to the social protection of these jobs

34169,the possible hardship cases are specified in paragraph 4 of the relevant article .
34170,it is only because Parliament has in the past made the most of the rights granted to it
34171,"with interinstitutional agreements of this kind and agreements with the Commission , such as the"
34172,I would particularly like to call for a strict wording on environmentally damaging subsidies
34173,I find the Council 's wording too weak .
34174,"I believe that whenever it is said that environmental protection costs money , we must first of all"
34175,this is a very effective savings option .
34176,that is why I strongly support the idea of reducing subsidies .
34177,"Mr President , I would like to return to the fax which Mr van Hulten made available"
34178,"it is not only about attending plenary sittings , but also about having other tasks"
34179,these are the tasks we have to do at home now .
34180,there is no session fee for the work at home .

34187,"I am referring to Article 38 of the Haarder report , which deals with"
34188,I wonder what this has to do with human rights !
34189,anyone who misuse a human rights report to play national domestic politics is 100
34190,there is therefore enough room for manoeuvre here .
34191,it is precisely from this point of view that it is necessary to draw attention to the

34195,the Bourlanges report has the great merit of bringing about a quantum leap in this

34197,"we have made great efforts to document the three levels of the EU : the constitutional level ,"

34230,I reject the European Union 's coordination of the Member States ' economic policies .
34231,it must remain the case that coordination is carried out by the Member States .
34232,the method of setting guidelines in the context of open coordination wherever the EU is not

34234,"we need competition in Europe between the different economic policies of the Member States , which in turn"

34236,"it was essential to create a directive which , on the one hand , does not force these"

34262,"we had recently considered that the allocation of the funds , if we do not get them now ,"

34316,we need a pension system .

34318,"however , Commissioner , we have seen the opposite in recent years ."
34319,the early warning agreement was a mockery .
34320,the member states have literally turned the early warning agreement upside down .
34321,this must be said clearly so that we can start a new environmental and consumer policy !
34322,"Furthermore , Commissioner , you should take this as an opportunity to think more and better about"

34376,the endless family concept that you apply cannot be imposed on all Member States .

34455,"in this case , it is a strict interpretation of the new Financial Regulation and the serious consequen"
34456,the common position has succeeded in reconciling the rights of insurance undertakings with the
34457,"the common position is balanced and , moreover , the result of a compromise negoti"
34458,the Council has allowed eleven years to pass .
34459,"given the length of the procedure , a swift approval would be an important step in"
34460,"in conclusion , I would like to stress that the various elements of the proposal , namely maintain"
34461,"on the basis of the results of the evaluation , which will be available by the end of"
34462,the new government has now embarked on a European path in many policy areas .
34463,it is pursuing cooperation with The Hague .
34464,it has stopped supporting separatist attempts in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
34465,it is currently undertaking difficult austerity measures in order to meet the precondition
34466,I therefore think that Croatia deserves support .
34467,it can be a factor of stability in the whole region .
34468,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
34469,Mr Karas said here this morning that there will be a large majority .
34470,I will not belong to that majority .
34471,I believe that the Commission proposal and the report continue a very fundamental paradigm shift in the European pension
34472,"Commissioner Byrne and Mr Fischler , we asked you , in the context of the procedure"
34473,"you said at the time : “ Yes , the open declaration should come . ”"
34474,"it did come , but it took another three or two and a half years before the proposals"
34475,but good thing wants to have a while .
34476,"as I said , the Council then withdrawn what was a good proposal from the Commission ,"
34477,"the European Union 's credibility is , of course , crucial ."
34478,we must act at home .
34479,the European Parliament has adopted a clear position on emissions trading by a very large majority .
34480,"I regret that the Council of Ministers has once again postponed the decision , and I"
34481,"the Council must adopt a clear concept quickly , and I believe that we , as the European Parliament"
34482,that is what it was supposed to be .
34483,"in three minutes , you cannot cover the whole issue , but I believe it is really important that"
34484,"this brings me to the second priority mentioned in this Community action , namely the"
34485,cross-border trade is a necessary step .
34486,there is now a pilot project that has finally started and hopefully will be a great success .
34487,"we will only succeed , however , if we simplify the application procedures and achieve better"
34488,"I would also like to state here that we do not need new instruments , but that we want"
34489,I would like to ask you once again to explain this to us .
34490,you made very dark hints about the difficulties in the committee responsible in July .
34491,"even when asked , you were not willing to specify that at the time ."
34492,you are absolutely right that the population must be involved in decision-making processes .
34493,"but that also means , of course , that democratically elected Members of Parliament must"
34494,I think that the excesses of the Council and the Commission 's secret diplomacy towards Parliament
34495,"the need for information and awareness-raising measures , which are more than technical conversion"
34496,the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not just comment on the Commission 's report .
34497,we welcome the priorities and measures proposed .
34498,"we have tried to make the report more concrete , to deepen it and – where we considered"
34499,if we consider that some EUR 80 million will be spent on this information campaign over
34500,I therefore believe that the Council of Ministers is not really interested in such tragedies .
34501,I find that tragic .
34502,it is bad when we as Members of Parliament pass on the calls for help and none of
34503,the sanctions are now slowly being relaxed .
34504,has it ever been considered to relax the sanctions only when the Serbian Government has really done something
34505,I don 't think so .
34506,"today we can build on that , and I am very happy that this horrific genocide by"
34507,"it is also positive , however – and I would like to agree with Mrs Iivari on"
34508,"however , we should recognise from this example that it is not always about absolute power ."
34509,thank God this House now has more powers in foreign policy than it had 20 years
34510,"it is important that those who are deprived of a moral voice be given a voice ,"
34511,a product is considered safe when its safety has been proven by an accredited testing body .
34512,this is especially important for small and medium-sized businesses .
34513,"because if we think about the precautionary principle and prevention , we must create incentives"
34514,"I believe that the inspection by a third , neutral body would be an important instrument for reduci"
34515,"and by relieving market surveillance and by looking ahead in the testing and certification ,"
34516,we are in a state of crisis whenever the future of Europe depends on the unanimo
34517,"this was the case with the sanctions against Austria , this was the case with the Iraq crisis"
34518,we are increasingly blaming Community objectives for national problems .
34519,"I therefore conclude by saying that the Convention has not failed , the Commission has not"
34520,we say clearly no to unanimity and yes to the democratic and fair double majority
34521,we say ' yes ' to the convening of the Convention after Christmas to discuss the failure of
34522,we can say that the budgeters have done their homework for enlargement with great brio
34523,thank you for the good cooperation !
34524,we have been preparing for this over the past few years and we must start in 2
34525,this also leads to a second consideration that we must face .
34526,how can we cooperate with other institutions in the area of recruitment and staffing ?
34527,"in the coming years , we will have the same tasks to fulfil in the individual areas"
34528,the implementing rules of this Regulation shall be adopted by comitology procedure .
34529,this means that tomorrow we will have to vote on a legal text whose exact content is
34530,nor can the Commission tell us exactly what these implementing rules will look like .
34531,"I think this is a very problematic process , which highlights the democratic deficit of Community"
34532,"I believe that medicines must , of course , be further developed and that we cannot reduce the"
34533,"and if patent law is no longer in place and compulsory licenses are granted ,"
34534,"we must help create conditions in that country that will encourage people to stay there , that will ensure"
34535,"we must also , of course , prevent Albania from becoming more and more a transit point for"
34536,"in fact , an earlier closure of the reactor units would be desirable ."
34537,"however , I must also say that the shutdown of nuclear reactors can never be achieved"
34538,it must also be clear that the country concerned needs substantial technical and financial assistance .
34539,"I must also point out that the Community acquis in the field of nuclear safety , and in particular"
34540,"at present , each Member State , and therefore also each candidate country , is free to choose"
34541,the only principle that everyone in the Union must adhere to is to ensure the highest international
34542,"like the Lamfalussy Group , we have set ourselves the objective of producing"
34543,"however , we will of course have to look closely at the future procedures ."
34544,"as Parliament , we must ask ourselves whether future procedures are sufficiently democratic"
34545,"I would just like to mention Basel II and the International Accounting Standards , which will in"
34546,"if all this is to be done in future in a comitology procedure , where a frame"
34547,"I therefore have no choice but to support the rapporteur , Mr Corbett ."
34548,so let us vote on Amendment No 3 first .
34549,that would then replace Amendment No 2 .
34550,"that is how it was discussed in committee , and then we could have this regulation very quickly"
34551,"once again , I would like to thank everyone who has contributed , and I hope that"
34552,"I would like to ask you , Commissioner , to express your thanks to the services , and in"
34553,"secondly , the KLA in Kosovo has allegedly been disarmed ."
34554,but where do weapons come from ?
34555,it ’ s not just a few Kalashnikovs that you can buy somewhere on the
34556,"in the world , America or American circles are interested in arms supplies ."
34557,"in conclusion , on behalf of the Socialist Group , I would like to thank Mr Maat for"
34558,"secondly , even if the Commission and the Council take a different position on this because they see"
34559,this is a mission under the authority of the United Nations and it cannot be the European Union a
34560,the other donor countries must also honour their commitments during this period in the interests
34561,if only all these good people who are speaking here had lived sixty years ago or
34562,that is why I once again urge the Council to look forward with us and to join us
34563,"as a member of the Committee on Budgets , I must also point out that , in the"
34564,it would be useful to start with those actions for which no financial framework has yet been established
34565,"together with the legislators in many Member States , we are of the opinion that pensions"
34566,what does this mean in detail ?
34567,longevity insurance means that the pension provider is obliged to pay me a fixed pension
34568,"it is therefore not allowed to pay the pensioner a fixed amount , nor to reduce"
34569,we must now work together to press the governments to ensure that Nice is a success .
34570,we should do this together and assume each other 's goodwill .
34571,the most important thing - and in this respect I understand the part of her remarks with which
34572,"we , as Members of the European Parliament , are constantly engaged in this issue ."
34573,because it was the people in Central Europe who made the change and the fall of communism possible
34574,Germany ’ s unity would not have been possible without Solidarnosc in Poland .
34575,"what has come out of the trialogue , at least to limit the damage the Council has"
34576,annex XV remains in the accession treaties and thus becomes primary law .
34577,everything else is hollow words for me .
34578,the proof of the contrary can only be taken in years .
34579,the Council has already proved that it is acting against Parliament .
34580,"I should like to say briefly that the Commission accepts Amendment No 2,"
34581,"in my view , the concern expressed in Amendment No 3 has now turned out"
34582,this is of course a matter of experience .
34583,"perhaps at some point , we will come to the conclusion that it should be mandatory ;"
34584,but you should first free them .
34585,I believe that this will also facilitate the implementation of this reform .
34586,"yesterday , the Commission said that it would not accept either 1 or 10 or"
34587,"we will therefore be engaged in the debate anyway , and it is therefore important"
34588,"but even if - and I will say this right away , so I do not need to take"
34589,it has the right of initiative and can decide anyway .
34590,"it is a recommendation , and if it does not pass now , I am in favour"
34591,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
34592,the scope and the flood of details of the proposals for necessary reform steps suggest
34593,"however , given the events that triggered these efforts , the need is also obvious ."
34594,hopes and expectations were all the more aroused by the strong announcements made by Commissioner
34595,the report is particularly striking in the concept of transparency .
34596,ensuring this is a major concern .
34597,the importance of fully traceable work cannot be overemphasized .
34598,"but it is not just a question of bureaucratic reform , but rather of demonstrating good"
34599,his confidence in EU policy must be regained .
34600,the citizen demands quick and open access to the institution and the readability of the
34601,"he draws his understanding from this , and he wants a successful policy and at the same time"
34602,"thirdly , the European Union cannot and must not expand without limits ."
34603,"its limits are not determined by how many countries want to join , but by how many"
34604,"all these are facts , Mr President , which I , as rapporteur , already called for"
34605,"let us now draw the right and necessary conclusions for 2006 , other"
34606,enlargement : of course we must prepare for enlargement .
34607,but anyone who thinks that preparing for enlargement only means creating new posts has not
34608,we must put everything that we have learned to appreciate and love in the way the European Parliament
34609,we are facing a great challenge if we want to master all this .
34610,nor is it a question of creating new posts now and filling them with officials from the
34611,why are there no other options on site ?
34612,"for example , the Commission intends to work with satellites in the translation sector in the candidate"
34613,"I thank Mrs Paulsen for her report , which makes the Commission 's proposal even more concrete"
34614,we must not ignore the concerns of the national Catholic lay movements and organisations in
34615,the subject of this report does not fall within the competence of EU policy !
34616,"according to the principle of subsidiarity , decisions on such matters must be taken at national"
34617,"in my opinion , trading in emissions certificates is immoral and does not solve the"
34618,the whole tax system must be made more environmentally friendly in the medium term .
34619,"the implementation of the White Paper 's targets for renewable energy sources , which"
34620,"Europol is toothless if it does not have enough staff , and at present only"
34621,Europol will also be toothless if the necessary technology is not made available .
34622,"therefore , a package of measures is urgently needed ."
34623,I would therefore like to see the Member States reminded of the necessity of
34624,"the second problem for me is that NGOs , however important they may be , are being called"
34625,"they are also being asked to take over control , and if 90 % of the"
34626,I think we should not overcharge anyone .
34627,what we should do is to give our full support to the Commission 's committed programme in
34628,"therefore , it would have been necessary to apply several practical alternatives to the fight"
34629,the current form is mediocre and unreasonable - I am glad that this is to
34630,"Austria has the strictest prohibition laws in the world , against fascism , against"
34631,we have learned from history and we know how to defend ourselves .
34632,"corruption flourishes , black party coffers are being created , and EU funds"
34633,critical dealing with ourselves is a prerequisite for the definition of real
34634,it should also be remembered that the Member States of the Union are not approaching the target
34635,"the opportunities are there , but they are not used ."
34636,"data protection , as Mr Glante has just mentioned , is mentioned more often here ,"
34637,all this is very vague .
34638,"there is a concrete proposal for this , namely automatic location detection , also independent of emergency"
34639,"firstly , this would be a loophole for the erosion of fundamental rights , even with"
34640,"the market does not rule everything and , secondly , the statements on data protection remain va"
34641,"thus , economic interests prevail over the protection of fundamental rights ."
34642,I am therefore voting against this report .
34643,I cannot agree with the use of Article 292 ( 2 ) here either .
34644,"it is certainly right and necessary to respond to urgent , compelling financial needs ,"
34645,"nevertheless , one cannot help but get the impression that we are dealing with a certain"
34646,"Parliament , of course , also on the basis of past experience , always very quickly suspects that"
34647,"as long as nuclear power plants are in operation in Europe , the top priority is to protect"
34648,"by adopting the report by my colleague Mr Schwaiger , we have made a significant"
34649,"these provisions , which are provided for in the organisation of the market in tobacco , can"
34650,I am very grateful that the Commission has announced in its White Paper on governance that
34651,"in fact , the creation of such agencies is of course not without its risks ,"
34652,"however , I would like to express a disagreement with the follow-up report ."
34653,"the Commission cannot , for example , accept the request in the follow-up report that the appointment"
34654,"this is not an interinstitutional body , but a Commission body for which the Commission itself is"
34655,"the favourable economic development must now , of course , be used to reduce structural deficit"
34656,"however , the growth dividend should also be used to invest in the knowledge society , in research and"
34657,actions such as Internet access in every school or lifelong qualification are a sensible approach here
34658,"finally , I think it is right that you have remained firm on the issue of sinks"
34659,"we should bring home measurable results , and by that I mean physically measurable"
34660,this began in the early 1980s with the very prophetic report on European

34662,"but in the decades that have passed since then , this House has been very consistent in"
34663,"Mr Deprez , I can answer your first question with a clear no , as you would like"
34664,the Union 's position on this issue will not change .
34665,"because there has been talk of existing inconsistencies , I would like to renew the"
34666,perhaps we can still clean up some of the Committee on Legal Affairs ' work tomorrow by
34667,I can also announce that we will no longer support all the amendments that we supported
34668,"High-risk pregnancies and multiple births require special assistance , and the health of expect"
34669,I hope that this is also important to the colleagues who are having a heated discussion .
34670,"we must speak with one voice in order to implement ILO Convention No 103,"
34671,"we see good starts in the new Commission , but it is about the 199"
34672,we must recover the confidence that the European public has lost in the European institutions .
34673,"we must restore confidence , and that means that we must , as a committee , take a"
34674,it is not about trivializing the problems or about sensationalism ;
34675,"we had to put positive pressure on it , and we see the decision as an opportunity , not"
34676,"but we should not concentrate solely on this tax issue , as some in the committee and"
34677,there are many areas of CO2 reduction that we cannot solve with a tax alone
34678,"I would like to give the example of stand-by switching , which is mentioned in"
34679,five to ten per cent of energy consumption in the European Union is wasted by not turning
34680,"five to ten percent , that is a huge contribution to energy savings that can be"
34681,it is clear to me that it must only be already produced stem cell lines that can be kept
34682,"for me , the overriding of the ethical limit lies where embryos are cultivated"
34683,that cannot be .
34684,Mitrovica must not remain divided !
34685,we had enough divided cities in Europe and we still have them .
34686,I think we must prevent this .
34687,"if KFOR is now being attacked , I can only say that these are our sons"
34688,we can expect that they will not be punished for volunteering to serve in Kosovo .
34689,"I therefore expect everyone there , whether Albanians or Serbs , to leave the KFOR"
34690,"I wish you , Mr President , all the best on behalf of our group ."
34691,no one will take it to heart if I say this today on behalf of the group that
34692,trust is also important in politics .
34693,you will always have an ally in our group - and I say this to the other groups
34694,the market cannot be controlled .
34695,preventive measures are therefore particularly important for safety and health .
34696,there are numerous references in the report to the fact that in the Member States operators
34697,the report aims to change this .
34698,I agree with you .
34699,"Parliament has proposed , among other things , that the existing national workers ' representatives should"
34700,an agreement without the participation of the local works councils is unthinkable !
34701,"the Commission initially reacted positively to various amendments , but - as you"
34702,what has been worked out in Parliament with so much effort cannot simply be put in the freezer
34703,the conditions for a common position of the Council must now finally be created .
34704,there is obviously a lack of political will in the Council .
34705,the Commission will also adopt the follow-up report on the Commission 's Green Paper next week
34706,the report evaluates the results of the public consultations and once again shows how important the
34707,I hope that the report which Mrs Theato is adopting here in the plenary will also

34711,and so the question arises for me whether the monetary policy strategy is optimal .
34712,the Bank itself has examined to what extent it can be satisfied with its monetar

34716,"if project applicants have to wait years to get the money from the European taxpayer ,"
34717,"I fully agree with what has been said by the Commission , both by President Prodi and by"
34718,"I would also like to remind you , on behalf of our group , that we still"
34719,"we should turn every euro around , and I am , as the President of the Commission knows"
34720,that is why we are calling on governments to reach a result in Copenhagen .
34721,"of course , the situation in reality is different ."
34722,I will give you an example :
34723,the Belgian Post cannot claim to serve a giant state .
34724,the Belgian Post cannot claim to be located in the periphery .
34725,"but the postal services are disastrous , even though they are in a reserved area ."
34726,"we are therefore releasing a next step , and Commissioner – this is the second motion"
34727,but I would like to respond very briefly to what you have said .
34728,"so first of all , why do we need a rice reform ?"
34729,"we do not need it because of the import of basmati rice , which is very low –"
34730,"we need it as a consequence of the decision – which , incidentally , was also taken"
34731,"Mr President , we have reached a high degree of agreement in the committee that self-handling must"

34739,"for example , we have done a study on gyms and found that teenagers , mainly"
34740,"we are therefore clearly dealing with a public health issue and , in this sense ,"
34741,"in general , I would like to say a word about the procedure itself ."
34742,"it is certainly a very fast-moving market , a rapidly evolving technology ,"
34743,but I just want to raise an explicit word of admonition once again .
34744,we as Parliament - and this concerns us - should not necessarily always deprive oursel
34745,"we see this once or twice when we are in need , but I think it must remain"
34746,let me give you a few more examples .
34747,if we succeed in putting forward some proposals in the political field at the ASEM
34748,just think of the issues of the People 's Republic of China and Taiwan or North and South
34749,"I believe that we can make a major contribution together in such a multilateral process , so"
34750,what we need – and Mr Brok has just mentioned this – is clear competences for
34751,the European Parliament is the parliamentary controller at European level vis-à-vis the Commission and
34752,the task of national parliaments is to exercise greater control over their own governments .
34753,"we do not want a congress of national parliamentarians , but rather we want the European Parliament"
34754,"once again , we are setting an example across all the groups – with the rapporteur ,"
34755,"we support you , Mr Byrne , in the Commission in Brussels , in having the possibilit"
34756,I thank you for the fact that you are obviously also in a position to present a proposal
34757,"it only makes sense if we work together to prevent this , and only then will the White Paper"
34758,I therefore hope that tomorrow we will really give the Council of Ministers a slap in
34759,the causes of the country 's poverty are primarily political .
34760,the failure to resolve the Transnistrian conflict is particularly serious .
34761,the European Union is currently considering how it can support the OSCE in its efforts to improve
34762,we have set up a relatively generous aid programme .

34775,we have already talked about the duplication of regulatory work .
34776,"it is certainly necessary to bring together national and European levels , although , of course"
34777,"secondly , we need reform that will really make the Union fit for the future ."
34778,"a constitutional-like process must therefore be initiated , in which a united Europe"
34779,"this , of course , includes a broad , open and public debate across Europe , which is essential"
34780,it is no longer the appropriate way to substantially advance Europe .
34781,"we need a method , and that method is the Convention , as many people have already mentioned"

34790,I can repeat on behalf of the Commission that we believe that the task in the Balkan

34793,"the 2004 budget is the last for which you are responsible , Commissioner ,"
34794,I therefore hope that we will be able to place the appropriate lines in the reserve
34795,we will be happy to release these items as soon as we have received the relevant documents .

34806,"not only has nothing changed in Malta 's basic political situation , namely the different assessment"
34807,"as rapporteur , I can only note this with regret ."
34808,"this does not mean , of course , that the European Parliament ignores the position of the Labour"

34823,today we are discussing how to move one step further towards this security union .
34824,we are discussing this in the context of the measures on money laundering .
34825,"if money is the engine of organised crime , then the measures to combat money laundering"
34826,"if we can prevent money laundering , then we will ultimately prevent organised crime ."
34827,organised crime – as has been mentioned here on several occasions and as we know –
34828,all this illegally earned money is laundered and introduced into the legal economic cycle
34829,"that is also the aim of organised crime , and therefore organised crime and money"
34830,the economy is dramatically undermined .
34831,that is why these measures to combat money laundering are so important .
34832,I now come to a point that particularly annoys me .
34833,"there is the reconstruction agency , the umbrella organisation in Thessaloniki ."
34834,the Stability Pact is based in Brussels .
34835,can anyone explain to me how stability in the Western Balkans is to be organised from

34843,what young person would want to justify his or her profession as a farmer ?
34844,young farmers want fair prices for their products .
34845,subsidies are not the reason why the decision to choose this profession is made .
34846,I believe it is extremely important that this pre-accession strategy is also implemented in
34847,"Cyprus , like Malta , is a relatively wealthy country in general , compared with the"
34848,this equal treatment in Cyprus should also be used to prevent the economic and social gap between the

34850,we have heard that Poland was to be given fewer votes in the Council of Ministers
34851,this was corrected because it was supposedly just a typo .
34852,"there is another typo : the Czech Republic and Hungary , which have the same population as Belgium"
34853,let us also give the Czech Republic and Hungary 22 MEPs and let us not start

34864,we will not support the US game of playing the interests of its workers against the interests
34865,where are the problems ?
34866,"Commissioner , your predecessor in office , Mr Bangemann , assured us at the"
34867,this is still a little bit stuck .
34868,I would like to ask you to say clearly how Parliament can be involved in the decision-
34869,"so , in concrete terms , how does the Commission ensure that Parliament 's codecision is not"
34870,the main focus of this draft is to find a solution to the outstanding issue of EU
34871,Practicality must be the top priority .
34872,"we need to produce realistic , applicable legislation ."
34873,"I am therefore pleased that a number of amendments from the first reading , for"
34874,these amendments were intended to intervene in pending legislative procedures by the
34875,and by these pending legislative procedures I mean those on genetically modified food and feed
34876,"just two weeks ago , we debated and voted on this in committee at second reading ."
34877,"the decision was very narrow , which means that opinions on this matter are very different ,"
34878,it would therefore be completely wrong to want to anticipate that .
34879,I will mention only three points here .
34880,"as an efficient working basis , we need to move to qualified majority voting in"
34881,we need pilot projects for the digital heritage and we need appropriate provisions of the
34882,"in order to protect consumers , it is also necessary that packaging materials are safe and"
34883,I have little opinion of developing environmental indicators for packaging .
34884,"instead , the Commission should develop specific criteria for assessing the environmental impact of packaging"
34885,this youth programme is an important instrument for learning to understand each other and to practice tolerance .
34886,volunteering activities in the field of environment and culture help to get to know the European reality
34887,only interpersonal contacts enable the practice of democratic values and the understanding of European citizens
34888,this program is for that purpose .
34889,I think that at this point it must also be said that it is unacceptable that the
34890,this is irresponsible and should be combated by everyone – above all by this Parliament and
34891,we are having a fundamental debate on asylum and immigration in Europe .
34892,that is what the guidelines for asylum and immigration in Europe are about .
34893,"we need to be clear about two things : firstly , the quotas to be applied and"
34894,"as far as methodology is concerned , European directives on asylum and immigration"
34895,only minimum standards can be made binding on the whole European Union .
34896,anything beyond this will not be accepted .
34897,"Mr Lehne pointed out that we had a directive on this very early on , which"
34898,"nevertheless , this amendment is necessary to take account of recent developments ."
34899,we welcome the fact that the directive is not only extended to banks but also to
34900,we also welcome the fact that the precursory offences are not limited to drug trafficking but
34901,"the difficulty with conventional rail transport , unlike high-speed rail transport ,"
34902,"nevertheless , the convergence process needs to be pushed forward for the sake of"
34903,the directive should therefore be implemented quickly .
34904,I would therefore simply ask all my fellow Members to use the summer break – and
34905,there is certainly room for negotiation here .
34906,let us conduct these negotiations seriously in the autumn and conclude them at
34907,"then we will be well on our way to bringing together the interests of the environment ,"
34908,"Madam President , Mr Deprez , I would like to thank you for your report ."
34909,"you were absolutely right when you named the values : low prices , high quality ,"
34910,but they have forgotten one feature .
34911,"in terms of national economy , we are obliged to ensure a high level of employment ."
34912,"because we also share these values , this Commission , this committee , has taken its decision in"
34913,"Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , although we have all supported the reports"
34914,the reasons for this are many .
34915,"I believe that one important reason is that , in comparison with the Americans , we European"
34916,this is the basis of our political work .
34917,"because we wanted to reconcile both sides , the arguments of Mrs Huhne , Mrs"
34918,the issue of party funding is a politically sensitive area .
34919,that is why it is important that we discuss it in all transparency and openness and regula
34920,the Commission hopes that we will have such a transparent system very soon .
34921,it is in the democratic interest .
34922,this is in the democratic interests of the Community .
34923,Mrs Lucas said today that an important objective is to promote their own industry .
34924,should I understand that she is referring to the monopolies owned by a few minister
34925,perhaps it would be useful to involve national parliamentarians and the opposition a little more in
34926,a few against millions who are starving .
34927,"we should therefore make every effort to promote small and medium-sized enterprises ,"
34928,"there are still political prisoners in Serbia today , and they were actually the political prisoners of"
34929,it is unacceptable that the political prisoners of Milosevic are still political prisoners
34930,"unfortunately , Koštunica missed the moment - when he became President - to give"
34931,"he missed that moment , but he could at least have freed the Albanian political prisoners"
34932,we want to ease the situation of the civilian population by calling once again on the Russian
34933,European research policy is perceived very strongly from the point of view of participation in
34934,I would like to urge the Commission to do everything possible to facilitate the submission and
34935,"the second is that the framework must , however , safeguard the European internal market and the"
34936,we want and should move between these two points .
34937,"finally , we in the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats know"
34938,"I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr McCartin , the other rapporteurs and the"
34939,the other countries must of course be considered and supported accordingly .
34940,that is clear .
34941,"there is no discussion about that , but I think Croatia is in the foreground at the moment"
34942,"if we have a number of cornerstones of regional development , such as Macedonia , Croatia and ,"
34943,"physical activity is good for health , and sporting competition also trains a number of social"

34945,it is not only in my own country that people are being told at the moment that they have

34947,"an embargo , an export ban , does not combat the BSE disease , but is merely"
34948,"this was the case in Great Britain , England and Portugal ."
34949,"we in our group have always said that this is not an English disease , but a European problem"
34950,"therefore , the criteria which now lead to the lifting of the embargo are appropri"
34951,"allow me to add a personal note in this connection , because as rapporteur for the Committee"
34952,"that is the way things are , and as rapporteur , you must of course reflect the opinion"
34953,but the personal note is that you will probably allow me to vote in favour of these a
34954,"strengthening these rights is actually a must for a Social Democrat , as there is no"
34955,"I would ask you , Mr President , to allow me to say this again tomorrow before the"
34956,"if I look at what the joint declaration of the summit says about Chechnya ,"
34957,that can 't really be all !
34958,the second point we have is the problem of polarization .
34959,"on the one hand , we say , there are the supporters of renewable energy sources"
34960,"on the other hand , there are energy suppliers , oil dealers , oil producers , and"
34961,"here , an enemy position is developed ."
34962,I believe that we should overcome this and recognise that these renewable sources of
34963,this enemy is ignorance of the fantastic possibilities that are available to us .
34964,"secondly , this is a report pursuant to Rule 37 ."
34965,we reserve the right – and I will discuss this with the other groups – to refer this back
34966,then we will most likely have to go into negotiations .
34967,I say this now only as a suggestion ;
34968,Members here will then be able to say what they think about it in the discussions .
34969,I just wanted to announce it .
34970,"Mr President , thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to do so ."
34971,that is exactly what Europe is all about .
34972,"we want to pursue certain objectives and interests together , while at the same"
34973,"nothing will change in this regard , nor should it change in the future ."
34974,we are currently experiencing a vicious circle .
34975,"ethnic minorities , the various peoples of the highlands in Vietnam are oppressed ,"
34976,"we thank the Cambodians for this , who themselves had a major problem with displaced persons"
34977,but the Cambodians then of course send the people back to Vietnam for all sorts of reason
34978,a real vicious circle .
34979,"we are making a law to keep the waters clean , which will cement yesterday 's"
34980,"that will be the consequence , in any case , if the opponents of the Committee"
34981,"unfortunately , our rapporteur , who should represent the opinion of the majority in the committee"
34982,"unfortunately , these opponents of advanced technology also include Members from groups and countries"
34983,"as regards the possibility of projects which involve training and education , I would point out that"
34984,we in the European Parliament are not against an agreement with Mexico either .
34985,on the contrary !
34986,"however , for the reasons I have already mentioned , we cannot approve this agreement ,"
34987,one last point : it is also necessary that there is a critical voice here in the European
34988,"Mr President , the PSE Group is convinced of the efforts made by Greece to meet the"
34989,we support the rapporteur 's recommendation and report .
34990,it is important that the European internal market is finally truly completed .
34991,this can only happen if all the Member States of the European Union become members of the monetary
34992,"it is therefore important for trade that all EU countries become members , especially those that can also"
34993,only then will an even larger part of the economic area be protected from exchange rate fluc
34994,"the independence of these institutions is of particular importance , and I believe that we should continue to"
34995,it would therefore perhaps be useful for the regulatory bodies to consider in which areas
34996,"thirdly , the European Union countries have long overlooked or underestimated developments in"
34997,the Commissioner has pointed out that it is lagging behind reality when the report mentions India
34998,I think that is a political mistake that does not take due account of the realities .
34999,"Realpolitik always has something to do with interests , and the EU is doing well to balance"
35000,other requirements in the report aim to increase transparency .
35001,"here , too , I would like to assure you that you are addressing a reform objective"
35002,"it wants to be an open Commission , which restricts information to its House wherever it"
35003,I am confident that these issues can be settled in the interinstitutional agreement .
35004,"this country has suffered a great deal under various dictators , under various wars ,"
35005,it is urgently necessary to restore the difficult balance between the tribes and ethnic groups
35006,I think it is obvious that – as Mr Watts said – the only issue that remain
35007,a solution must be found to this .
35008,I do not want to hide the fact that I am not personally 100 %
35009,"but I think that if we want to remain united as a Parliament , we must also be united"
35010,that is why you have to be able to put your own concerns aside from time to
35011,but abstaining from voting is also a way of showing that Parliament is united .
35012,"nevertheless , it is right and welcome that the EU Troika is signalling its willing"
35013,the efforts of the UN Special Envoy to advance talks with the President-elect and
35014,"in addition , these weeks are showing that the European Union can make a significant contribution where"
35015,I believe that the anti-terror coalition in the Middle East would not have been so
35016,the procedures for granting the exemptions should be simple .
35017,"Parliament cannot , however , agree to a general mandate for the Commission to be able to a"
35018,"in theory , it would then be possible to amend all the annexes again the day after"
35019,such a regulation is not in the spirit of good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission .
35020,let us not forget - despite last year 's crisis - that great success has been
35021,it was and is absurd that vaccinations against foot-and-mouth disease are stigmatized
35022,what to do in case of the case ?
35023,timely handling of protective emergency vaccination ?
35024,I would add flexibility in the case of ring vaccination .
35025,let us now - and I call on the Commission and all of us to do so - walk
35026,this Parliament agrees that we must go along this path together .
35027,"Mr Verheugen , I would ask you to recognise this as such ."
35028,"in principle , we stand with the Commission when it comes to the future development of Europe , the"
35029,it is our political and moral obligation to do everything possible to ensure that this enlargement can
35030,"this is in the interests of security , peace and freedom on our European continent ."
35031,I really have to tell you that there is a problem that simply arises from our rules in
35032,"the new Member States have to pay the full contribution from the start , but as you know"
35033,we are not only faced with the difficulty of having to prevent new Member States from be
35034,that is the problem at hand at the moment .
35035,England and Scotland also have very different criminal laws and legal traditions .
35036,this means that we must not only be very careful in pursuing unification and harmoni
35037,"we talk a lot about a European community of values , but the fact that this European community"
35038,"a very concrete example of this is the euthanasia legislation in the Netherlands , which has"
35039,we therefore have even a divergence in essential areas that are also relevant to criminal law .
35040,"in this respect , such mutual recognition is becoming increasingly difficult ."
35041,this is a question which also has to do with the different value systems and the different legal culture
35042,"we therefore welcome progress in this area , but we are very sceptical and see here simply"
35043,"we therefore urge the Commission to proceed carefully , to provide precise definitions"
35044,"of course , we know that there are considerable problems today ."
35045,"however , the cases I have mentioned – and I could also cite drug policy as an example"
35046,"Madam President , as a member of the Austrian Freedom Party , I respect the concerns of"
35047,you will perhaps be surprised at my reaction when I say that I personally understand the
35048,flexible regulations for the movement of people and goods are important prerequisites for
35049,we have seen this at the open borders with Poland and Lithuania .
35050,most of Kaliningrad ’ s economic indicators are rather negative and still do not show a positive
35051,the standard of living in the border region is considerably lower than the overall Russian level .
35052,I also believe that citizens have a right to know who voted and how they voted on
35053,this publicity of the Legislative Council is urgently needed .
35054,I do not think that the number of specialist councils is the problem .
35055,the problem is the lack of coordination within the Council and also within the governments of
35056,this must be changed .
35057,"sending a permanent minister to Brussels to coordinate government policy at national level is , I"
35058,"if we have to bear this financial part , and I also confess to this , then it must"
35059,"in spite of all the pessimism that I unfortunately share , I wish the"
35060,the situation of America 's withdrawal or restraint is also a great opportunity for

35062,"I wish you success , and if you succeed , we will succeed together ."
35063,"you do not belong to our party , but I wish you success , because it is about"
35064,but the question arises as to how far the authority of both the military victors and the

35068,to the content : we need to limit and control immigration .
35069,"Mr President-in-Office , you mentioned the term ‘ Fortress Europe ’ ."
35070,"precisely because we do not want to build a Fortress Europe and cannot do so ,"
35071,Commissioner Vitorino 's course does not meet these demands .
35072,"at second reading in committee , my group fully supported all four amendments tabled by"
35073,"we will of course also support Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 and"
35074,"since I am only representing Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten , allow me to use"
35075,she said that the other amendments were simply nonsense .
35076,we encourage the Commission and the Council to stick to their course .
35077,"we will always defend Israel 's security , as we have always done in the past , but"
35078,"Mr President , the vote on Sellafield was a first in the European Parliament ."
35079,I believe that this is the first time that the European Parliament has spoken out in favour
35080,I believe that it is urgently necessary for the Council to decide before the first accession
35081,I believe that it is also the concern of the European Parliament to say that those who work in
35082,"it is not enough to repeat certain criticisms , but the task is then to work"
35083,"Mr President , we have also attached a financial statement to the package of measures that we"
35084,"in this sense , we believe that these funds are secured ."
35085,we are expecting to remain below the limit agreed in Berlin in the 200
35086,"in other words , this way we are able to take advantage of the space that has been"
35087,let me say a word as my personal assessment :
35088,"Spontaneously , we always react with restraint when the Commission 's"
35089,"above all , the Commission itself is reacting there with great restraint , which is"
35090,"nevertheless , we must of course consider whether we should not re-examine this issue"
35091,I would like to question whether this meets democratic requirements .
35092,"in this respect , the decision we are taking today is also a crutch in order to achieve"
35093,"we are not going to start singing here , but we would like to say something simple to"
35094,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very happy ."
35095,"the proclamation of the Charter was an important step for the citizens of the European Union , even"
35096,"in any case , further efforts at all levels are needed to continue this important process ."

35102,may Mr van Hulten start saving now !
35103,"Madam President , I do not think we should miss this opportunity to commemorate this anniversary"
35104,we have achieved a lot .
35105,we could do without a debate because we have already achieved everything .

35112,we want to fight VAT fraud in Europe so that the European Union 's revenue side is

35888,33 % of the adult population of Zimbabwe is infected with HIV .
35889,between 2 000 and 5 000 people die every day

35891,poverty exacerbates the misery of these people .

35997,we therefore call on the military government to return to constitutionality .

36121,I would like to thank you very much for this opportunity to inform you of the state of play
36122,"I would also like to take this opportunity to briefly outline , in a somewhat broad"
36123,this Parliament represents the people of Europe .
36124,we are the only institution in Europe that can rightly claim this .
36125,"that is why the administration of this House is there for the Members , not the other way"
36126,I think that we have also succeeded in putting this consideration into figures and put
36127,"today , we are to adopt a position with Parliament on the decisions to be taken by the"
36128,we have spent over a year trying to find a common line with hearings and many discussion
36129,the EU Commission ’ s position on this issue was objective and – I believe – successful .
36130,"for this , I would also like to thank the Commission , which is obviously not yet here"
36131,the Commission has provided a comprehensive description of the Community legal framework .
36132,"she has set out the principles of neutrality , discretion and proportionality , which we"
36133,"I would like to thank you , Mrs Theato , and of course the whole committee , for"
36134,a second point that is important to me is the fight against corruption within Turkey .
36135,"as long as corruption in Turkey determines public and social life , the population has no confidence"
36136,"however , it cannot be the case in a democratic society that the military , in the form"
36137,I think that there is still a lot of work to be done on this within Turkey .
36138,this can only be achieved by combating corruption and by strengthening the public ’ s confi
36139,"finally , I would like to point out the following :"
36140,"any delay in the Commission proposal would mean that most of the changes which , according to the"
36141,the Commission considers this to be an unnecessary disadvantage for the sector .
36142,"that is why the proposal has just been tabled , and I hope that Parliament will give its"
36143,I would just like to recall the issue of the proliferation of weapons ;
36144,because there are political contacts and relations with one or another ASEM member country or mutual depende
36145,"I would point out , however , that there is only one major difference between the resolutions we"
36146,everything else is virtually identical in content .
36147,that is why I find it completely incomprehensible why claims have been made this morning
36148,"this is definitely not the case , and it is indecent to make such a claim"
36149,I would like to make that very clear at this point .
36150,the amendments tabled by Parliament and the rapporteur are therefore – in my view
36151,"at the same time , it must of course be said that this programme also has a special aspect"
36152,"it is also a matter of bringing renewable , environmentally friendly energy production to these"
36153,"the media in Europe are full of it , and we in Parliament have not yet dealt with"

36158,"as regards Temelin , the report is disappointing , given that the European Parliament called"
36159,"as regards Turkey , Mr Silva , I would like to say that the picture"
36160,there are positive elements .
36161,it is undoubtedly a positive element that the Accession Partnership is now working in
36162,all elements are there and are perceived .
36163,"in this respect , relations between us and Turkey have long been less close than they are now ."
36164,it is undoubtedly a positive element that there has been remarkable progress in constitutional
36165,but it certainly still depends on the extent to which we see these constitutional changes
36166,"Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , 15 January"
36167,"we have elected a new President and I would like to extend to you , Mr President ,"
36168,"secondly , self-regulation by sector – such as the code of conduct for telecom"
36169,not everything needs to be overregulated by the legislator .
36170,these are all ideas that we would not like to do without .
36171,"they may be so old , but they are still extremely current ."
36172,"we are showing here that the national identities and cultures in Europe , which are so"
36173,"as regards Amendment No 6 , I must say that technical measures can only"
36174,"in paragraph 16 , you call for an evaluation of public budgets from the point"
36175,"this is an important point , also for me personally ."
36176,I should like to point out that various measures are being taken in this area as well .
36177,I hope to be able to provide you with further information and reports next year on International Women
36178,"we always talk about a lot of mobility , flexibility and the internal market ."
36179,"we must say very clearly today that mobility , flexibility and a functioning internal"

36181,it is about the interrelationship of all three pillars of the pension system .
36182,you cannot just leave the load on one pillar .
36183,"Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the European Union is a European Union of"
36184,admiration for Othmar Karas .
36185,Mr García-Margallo y Marfil said he had won a bullfight .
36186,"I am angry with my Spanish colleague , I do not like bullfights ,"

36195,"in this respect , the question that the President-in-Office of the Council raised at"
36196,"such debates can only be held if all the information that the Council has , which is discuss"
36197,"according to the information available to the Commission , in a statement on 10 January 2"
36198,the statement by the Bulgarian Energy Minister did not concern Units 1 and 2 .

36201,"this will ensure a process with effective involvement of national parliaments , which has not been possible"
36202,the previous coexistence of the institutions would be replaced by coexistence .
36203,I would like to support the previous speakers .
36204,"there is a contradiction – unanimity , codecision and the Conciliation Committee –"
36205,"lastly , this House has repeatedly and by a large majority called on the Commission to"
36206,this public prosecutor should initially be responsible for fraud cases within the European institutions .
36207,this issue has certainly been mentioned by previous speakers .
36208,"on this condition , the introduction would be possible immediately and without prior amendment of"
36209,this was recommended by the five wise men in their report on the reform of the Commission
36210,Parliament had set the Commission a deadline of the end of March to make its statement on this
36211,"Mrs Schreyer , I asked you about this at the last plenary session ."
36212,will I finally get a clear statement from you today ?
36213,"thirdly , if it is true that the American services do not carry out economic espiona"
36214,why not ?
36215,"I agree with you , Commissioner , that the rules in force must be tightened ."
36216,it is not enough to impose sanctions at national level alone ; we also need measure
36217,"as you have rightly pointed out , we need the framework directive because many of"
36218,"we have a very sensitive ecological area at the Brenner , in a region that affect"
36219,"today , 1.2 million trucks pass through the Brenner Pass every year ."
36220,the development in the transport of goods is far above the previous growth rates .
36221,"passenger traffic , as an expression of one of the freedoms of the European Union , can"
36222,"on Good Friday , traffic on the Brenner axis came to a standstill for hours ."
36223,"Commissioner , Madam Vice-President , I hope that tomorrow after the vote you will review all"
36224,"after all , the Commission usually always makes proposals taking account of the Member States , and per"
36225,"secondly , the directive is not intended to protect trivial software ."
36226,"patents on trivial software , such as the progress bar , are very questionable and"
36227,the directive also makes it clear that we do not want to grant patent protection to trivi
36228,this brings me back to the last speaker .
36229,"of course , we must distinguish between the fact that , in the operational area , there"
36230,that is not a problem .
36231,"we have fifteen countries in the European Union today , and twelve have applied for membership"
36232,if we proceed according to the EEA system - we set common rules and then consult the
36233,"that is why I also think that the approach is right , that the European Commission should , in"
36234,"we do not need multilingualism , but unanimity on the issue of the regulatory"
36235,"our task must be to reposition sport in a changed society with new modern , technical and medical"
36236,I think that a year of sport could address these problems and make a significant contribution .
36237,"for more than 15 years , Spain has exported clementines to the United States"
36238,"there have been some problems here and there , but they have always been solved very quickly ."
36239,"now , a few fruit fly larvae have been found under quite questionable circumstances"
36240,"competition policy is undoubtedly a value in itself , but it must be recon"
36241,"I expect your understanding for this , Commissioner ."
36242,we need this directive to put in place a working waste management system for packaging in all

36244,"a lot of money will flow there in the coming years , so this is very important ."
36245,"Mr President , I have the right to make both a personal statement and a point of order ."
36246,Mr van Hulten asked me to respect democratic decisions .
36247,it was a democratic decision of this House that this report should be dealt with this after
36248,I have not violated a democratic decision .
36249,"secondly , you have referred to Rule 145 , and I draw your attention"
36250,"that means that if Rule 145 had really been applied , one Member from each group"
36251,I really ask that these things be clarified !
36252,"I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Bösch , for his report and I would"
36253,the European Parliament has a central role to play in this context and I think that the monetary
36254,I think that we in this European Parliament owe it to the relatives of the victims to
36255,that is the first point I want to make .
36256,"however , this is not the path we want to take in the future of Europe ."
36257,with all due respect for the Human Rights Convention – we need more !
36258,we need our own charter with our answers to the questions of our time .
36259,with a balanced relationship from classic liberal rights to an adequate set of economic rights to good
36260,the European Convention on Human Rights does not fulfil this task .
36261,it cannot afford it because it was created in the 1950s under completely
36262,"in this sense , it is time for us all to call for constructive work on our own"
36263,"the Convention on Fundamental Rights for the European Union , those 62 politicians of whom"
36264,let us support him in this !
36265,"however , two points that I would like to explain below should be corrected ."
36266,Coccidiostatics and histomonostatics do not belong as additives in animal nutri
36267,we must be consistent in this .
36268,"if we ban antibiotics in animal feed in general , we cannot immediately create another exception"
36269,this is no longer explainable to consumers .
36270,I would also like to stress - and this is particularly to the credit of the rapporteur
36271,"in particular , Mr Bourlanges proposed the creation of a new administrative unit , which"
36272,the Commission has agreed on a timetable for reforming the existing system .
36273,"however , I would also like to point out that we will have the opportunity this week , on"
36274,then it will be precisely this extension of three years and the consequences of it that will
36275,I therefore see no need for a framework directive in this area .
36276,"rather , clarification of the interplay of the directives in force there would be important"
36277,"unlike some of the previous speakers , I cannot expect this from an additional framework directiv"
36278,measures must be taken which take account of the effects of the integration of developing
36279,"Nigeria can serve as an example here again , where oil production brings with it corresponding environmental"
36280,"here too , education and training measures must be promoted in order to ultimately help people"
36281,"the content of the regulation therefore deserves full support , but the financial resources proposed"
36282,I would therefore ask all Members to vote in favour of Amendment No
36283,we must already now consider a substantial increase in the revision of the Treaty or the regulation
36284,... but if Mr Poettering is calling out that the Chancellor did not talk to a Commissioner
36285,talking is of no use at all !
36286,I believe that this is a crucial difference that must also be clarified in the debate in the
36287,"in return , we must say - something that we do not all know here , but that you"
36288,you can imagine what they mean by quality there .
36289,the question of why it was forgotten has not been answered to this day .
36290,Parliament has central demands on this .
36291,it expects the Commission to approve only those programmes which have been developed in such a

36293,"I can only say , go with it to your regions and explain to your constituents why the"
36294,I can tell you that you will not get away with it completely unscathed .
36295,the idea of the Stability Pact is good because it is also designed primarily for cross
36296,some politicians and local governments have understood this and have already created a cross-
36297,"the European Union can establish a successful , exemplary policy by using this instrument consistently"
36298,"all those involved in the Stability Pact , however , need a long breath ."
36299,establishing and consolidating stability takes time and continuity .

36306,"the whole thing is now taking on grotesque features , because it was not even possible to reach"
36307,"we are even in danger of losing the money from 2001 , and then"

36321,"however , since these points and the majority decision in Parliament in paragraphs 53 and"
36322,I believe that this must be emphasised and that it must also be pointed out that

36324,"the processed healthy bones in meat meal , on the other hand , are said"
36325,whoever wants to understand that .
36326,we could illustrate these facts by countless examples .

36329,the Belgian Presidency has tried to break the ice in relations and open up ways of dialogue
36330,she took three important considerations as a starting point :

36345,this is the way we can bind Russia to the EU .
36346,I cannot see how we are going to overcome the so-called digital divide that exist

36348,our amendment is one of 24 amendments aimed at ensuring

36350,"finally , the guarantee of codecision in future procedures is worth mentioning ."
36351,"as pleasing as this result is , we cannot rest on our laurels ."
36352,what is now needed is the implementation of the Water Framework Directive .
36353,the meetings with the various representatives of the fisheries sector have also shown that
36354,"despite differing opinions , the majority of those concerned agree that we need to"
36355,"in particular , we need to strengthen controls , improve implementation , reduce discards"

36452,the Commission must have the courage to state the reasons for this .
36453,"either it is the fault of the incompetent administration or , for general political reason"
36454,I believe that this will be the test of the new funding system .
36455,increased trust in the recipient states also requires the recipients to be

36470,"the only thing that is possible is to put together a package , as we have done in Lithuania"

36481,many details show that mutual trust in the different judicial systems of the Member States is not yet
36482,it is certainly useful to push the development ahead .
36483,Mrs Van Brempt 's report goes beyond the Commission communication .
36484,"in particular , a binding 50 % reduction in the use of pesticides would"
36485,experts warn that such a reduction will promote the formation of resistance .
36486,a higher weed infestation then requires the use of larger amounts of plant
36487,"the application of an active substance is rather a question of location , local weather and the general"
36488,a mandatory levy on plant protection products certainly does not really minimise risks –

36491,"if you want to change the political system , you must also exert the corresponding economic pressure"

36494,as far as Nice is concerned – many have said so – we are not satisfied
36495,the decision-making procedure in the Council is more complicated than before .

36511,the Commission has proposed to review the directive in 2004 .
36512,we in committee proposed to do this one year earlier .
36513,we have also agreed that the time limitation of this directive should be maintained .
36514,"in 1997 , in the crucial vote on the last directive , I said"
36515,"I think it is good that we continue to do this , because it puts the pressure on"

36520,the current excessive bank charges are exactly the opposite signal .

36526,"thirdly , it hurts that there is no European response to the dramatic shortage of air"
36527,this issue belongs in this package of regulations and should be addressed as soon as
36528,the Commission is currently preparing a proposal to the Council on the application of Article 36
36529,I would like to remind you that this provision provides for consultations between the parties to
36530,"further measures or sanctions will be discussed at a second stage , based on the"
36531,it is therefore too early at this stage to consider further measures or sanctions .
36532,any response should be well thought out and targeted .
36533,we should avoid the impact of a trade ban called for by trade unions in Australia and New
36534,it is irresponsible to deliberately - I emphasise deliberately - create
36535,this is contrary to human rights .
36536,this is also a division of human dignity if we deliberately produce embryos as spare
36537,Parliament must therefore use its ability to act .
36538,"unfortunately , the governments of the European Union have also taken too little care of this"
36539,I hope that this will change in the near future .
36540,the current regulation of old-age and survivors ’ insurance contradicts the principle of

36560,"the trial is a farce , and it is far from clear whether the court will overturn"
36561,"unfortunately , three of the committee 's amendments that were important to me were"
36562,they will be put to the vote again in plenary .
36563,"firstly , they relate to cooperation with third countries in the field of migration ."
36564,here we want to add EUR 5 000 000 more to the

36566,"Mr President , whatever one uses to express oneself in private or personal terms - I always"
36567,the second problem is directly related to this and is very practical .
36568,I appeal to the Commission to link humanitarian aid more closely to development policy in terms
36569,"the Commission has already taken steps in this direction , but I believe that they should be considerably"
36570,"I am convinced that the concept of development-oriented emergency assistance , as the Society for"
36571,"the real question we are facing is , of course , to put it provocatively ,"
36572,"I agree with the previous speaker , Mr Laschet , that Europe has unfortunately not played"
36573,that is the fact .
36574,"now , of course , it is primarily a matter of will , as Commissioner Patten always"
36575,are we willing to play a role at all ?
36576,"I believe – and the Morillon report , which will be adopted by a large majority ,"
36577,"the second line , B5-234 , concerns the promotion of European digital content"
36578,Commissioner Liikanen has told us that there will be about 1.2 million additional jobs
36579,"we must train people , we must ensure that this labour market of 1.2 million jobs"
36580,"this will put us in the right position in the Internet , in e-commerce , in the"
36581,"some have criticised the fact that we , as the rich part of the world , continue to"
36582,I see it a little differently .
36583,I believe that we should not make the mistake of constantly repainting the old pictures of
36584,4 % of the Community budget will not be enough to disrupt the world 's
36585,"in addition , I do not think we have anything to blame on ourselves in terms"
36586,"the European Union alone imports more agricultural products from developing countries than the USA ,"
36587,"finally , I would like to stress that , although Cyprus has legislation on combating"
36588,"nevertheless , the number of immigration cases is increasing , which suggests that it"
36589,the report should cover these tasks to a greater extent .
36590,"I would like to remind you of the imminent enlargement to the east , where"
36591,I also think that all that has been put together in a new Article 12a is
36592,"the Commission has rightly , also on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity , refr"
36593,the opportunity lies in the fact that a successful socialization process can prevent protectionism and nationalism
36594,this is especially important in border areas where several cultures collide with each other .
36595,it has just been mentioned :
36596,if protein broth and water are now being pumped into chicken breasts in order to sell
36597,"and that is why it is important that we strengthen trust , the legitimate trust ."
36598,but this has to do with the fact that the power of judgment of consumers is
36599,"so it is not only the producer who has to bear the responsibility , of course also on"
36600,"at the same time , I expect the Commission to reconsider whether the proposed reduction in"
36601,we must ensure that there is international monitoring to monitor the human rights violations by the army there
36602,I certainly support all the calls to invite President Putin and Mr Mashadov to Strasbourg

36604,this is the final procedural step towards the long-awaited Community-wide regulation for limit

36609,"last year , in 2001 , almost all the available funds were also spent"
36610,this is really a serious change compared to previous years .
36611,"this is where the reform and , above all , the measures taken by my colleagues"
36612,"in such a situation , it is understandable that defence mechanisms are sought , even"
36613,"I do not want to defend them , and there must be punishment , but then you"
36614,"in addition , as you have written , we must also look at agricultural policy , in"
36615,"at the time , we had a situation where the 90s limit , which applied in"
36616,this created a more stable market in France and there was a very strong desire from other countries
36617,this put France and the beef price under pressure .
36618,"so here too , agricultural policy must ensure equal conditions , so that the 2"
36619,or this measure must apply in all countries .
36620,I would like to remind you once again that this inequality has created great difficulties within
36621,"therefore , whenever the Commission resorts to such penalties , it must always take the"
36622,"when deciding whether to redirect or discontinue aid , it must be borne"
36623,"if we should stop such projects , we would probably be giving more support to the extremists"
36624,we must therefore create the framework conditions so that young people see rural areas as an opportunity
36625,"start-up and investment aid is essential for young farmers , but it is just as"
36626,they must be as familiar with computers and the Internet as they are with the seed and the

36628,"whether it is Abu Jamal in the USA , Öcalan in Turkey , or even"
36629,I consider the death penalty to be a barbaric …
36630,a crucial issue for the confidence of participants in the reliability of electronically concluded legal
36631,"advanced signatures , because they are particularly secure , will in future be equalised"
36632,but even simple signatures must not be denied legal validity and use as evidence .
36633,the future of tourism in Europe lies in the development of sustainable tourism that takes into account and
36634,especially in the tourist country
36635,Austria places the principle of sustainable development in the tourism sector at the top of its priority
36636,I therefore welcome the Commission 's initiative to draw up and implement an Agenda 2

36647,you know what procedure we are in .
36648,"if you say you cannot accept them , we will react tomorrow and then we will"
36649,"finally , I would like to point out once again that we have made an offer to Turkey"
36650,"what is now at stake is the implementation of the first step of this Helsinki strategy , and"
36651,"it is now a matter of taking the first step , and it is your responsibility as Member"
36652,"but things are not that simple , of course , because the basic problem , Commissioner Verheugen"
36653,the basic problem is how we inform the people in the Member States about the accession of Eastern
36654,that is the crucial thing we have to do !
36655,but there is a deficit in all of us .
36656,this can only be done by making it clear to people time and again that the magnitude of
36657,we must make that clear !
36658,"for this , you , Mr President of the Commission , and I , Commissioner , must get out"
36659,let us really raise what we do to the historical height to which it belongs !
36660,I am very grateful to Mrs Napoletano for her report .
36661,we are on the same wavelength .
36662,"I have one concern , Mrs Groeneveld , so I would ask you to recon"
36663,"with regard to Turkey , I would like to say that Turkey would consider this to be an extreme"
36664,it would consider it a downgrade if we said that a country which we are currently preparing
36665,I must say clearly :
36666,the countries covered by this initiative are not intended for membership – at least not
36667,I know – and I know you well enough to know that – that you certainly do not
36668,so I ask you to reconsider this point !

36671,"fourthly , we need multilateral cooperative relations , not unilateralism ."
36672,"Fifthly , we need disarmament policy once again ."
36673,you cannot want to disarm others by war and at the same time rearm yourself and then
36674,"as far as Objective 1 areas are concerned , there is no operational aid"
36675,I therefore see no possibility of paying specific income support to farmers under Objective

36678,I would therefore like to pursue the underlying concern in order to find solutions
36679,but they should be simple solutions .
36680,I do not believe that we should create new bureaucracy with this .
36681,that means that all those involved have to think about what they can do better .
36682,"I believe that the Commission should be more prompt in its response , both to Member States and in"
36683,"the report shows , as Mr Oostlander rightly says , that the door is open , but"
36684,"now there are some who emphasize the open door , others emphasize the difficult path"
36685,I personally and the majority of my group believe that both sides should be supported
36686,"the starting point was the Kemalist philosophy of state , which Mr Oostlander criticised"
36687,"I also think that Kemalism has two sides , a positive side , supporting the republic"
36688,but in the shadow of Kemalism – and this is not due to Kemalism itself –
36689,"well , the new government , as the Commissioner has already mentioned , has a slightly"

36699,I would like to comment very briefly on two or three comments that have been made in the
36700,Mr Hänsch said – and I agree with much of what he said – that the safety of
36701,but so that there is no misunderstanding between us :
36702,you said that these nuclear power plants must be shut down before the accessions take place .
36703,this is something completely new .
36704,the policy has been to agree with these countries on dates for the closure of nuclear power
36705,that was the prerequisite for the opening of negotiations .
36706,so it happened .
36707,I do not hope that these countries will be able to join only after the agreed closure
36708,I assume that was just a linguistic misunderstanding .
36709,"however , I find it a drop in the ocean that the Council was unable to get it"
36710,its present form as a mixed agreement means that it will not enter into force until it has
36711,"Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very happy ."
36712,"it is the responsibility of this Parliament , of us , to ensure that Europe and the European"

36715,"I would first of all like to say to you , Professor Prodi , that as President of"
36716,it is no surprise that our judgment on the collegial body is more differentiated
36717,"some have made brilliant use of the opportunity of the hearing , for example Chris Patten"
36718,"however , you have a candidate in your luggage who is linked to a donation"
36719,this candidate could become a burden on the Commission .
36720,"I take the liberty of making this warning because the restoration of confidence , which you"
36721,I would like to say to the Liberals who have spoken here that they are five years
36722,"of course , European employment policy has already proven itself ."
36723,"the analyses show that the Member States have taken many sensible initiatives , that they are taking"
36724,"in our committee , we do not want new jobs in the service sector with incomes below the"
36725,definition of night work
36726,"I also think it is particularly good that we , as Parliament , are calling on the national"
36727,"as a committee , we have always tried to emphasise this cooperation with the national parliament"
36728,this is the consistent implementation of the gender mainstreaming concept .
36729,I expect that the male actors will finally start to fight against the gender roles and stereo

36731,I would just like to remind you that Parliament has said that the second tranche of

36733,I would like to remind you of this resolution once again .
36734,"I would like to speak about this 42-point climate protection programme , and in particular"
36735,"the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy has generally welcomed this programme because we believe that action"
36736,but there can be no doubt that the responsibility for meeting the climate protection objectives
36737,the third reason is that it has also become clear in the course of implementation that the Member

36739,this could perhaps be helpful for implementation and would also have the positive effect of better

36742,this urgent motion is about the set-aside areas being used to grow protein feed and
36743,this is an old demand of Parliament which is now finally being met .
36744,the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has negotiated with the Council Presidency to introduce this
36745,that is why our committee supports this urgency .
36746,this is also a way of providing financial compensation to the cattle farms affected
36747,Commissioner Schreyer will be pleased with this .
36748,I ask the House to approve this motion .
36749,whether the questions have such a suggestive power that we like the answers that have now
36750,who knows what would have come out of a different question .
36751,I would therefore advise that we do not make hasty decisions or hasty assessment
36752,"but , and I am coming to my conclusion , I would like to make it clear once again"
36753,I therefore also think that the Committee on Budgetary Control must concentrate much more on the
36754,I think that we can work well together with the Commission in this respect .
36755,"in particular , the following must be optimized :"
36756,"Commissioner , it is crucial - Mr Sterckx was kind enough to give you three years for"
36757,"the Erika would not have had to sink if it had been able to enter the port ,"

36760,"what surprised me , however , was that the Council , at its meeting on 2 December"
36761,"this means that we have not achieved what we wanted , namely the Communityisation of the"
36762,the consequence is that it is not the Commission that is steering this instrument in the Community

36790,in order to be able to get a real assessment of the BSE situation in the Member

36792,another element is the question of route charges .
36793,"we believe that in the medium and long term , the route charges should be increased in order"
36794,"after all , only if the users - the user pays - in other words the railway companies ,"
36795,"Mr President , I would also like to raise a point of order and suggest that the Bureau"
36796,I would ask the Bureau to consider this proposal so that we can properly deal with the
36797,that would be a proposal that the President could consider .
36798,if in five years ' time we have legislation that no longer allows animal feed but only

36802,I would ask you to be just as fair and also to approve the compromises .

36822,I would like to respond to the specific questions that have been raised .

36879,"in the explanatory statement to my report , I have listed in great detail the points"
36880,I would like to mention a few important points :
36881,the relationship with the e-commerce directive has been clarified .
36882,the relationship with the Brussels II Regulation and the Rome Convention has been clarified .
36883,"this could perhaps have been better in terms of text , but legally the relationship is now"
36884,the Directive applies to all consumers .
36885,"the restriction to consumers established in the Community , which Parliament criticised at first reading ,"
36886,"the list of pre-contractual information , a central point of the directive , includes"
36887,I would therefore like to expressly thank the rapporteur for having put this report on the
36888,"it is also an interference with the freedom of the press if , for example , as in"
36889,I think everyone in this House knows that the European Parliament has played an important and driving

36891,I believe that the way in which President Cox has represented the European Parliament in Central and

36893,we have heard in recent days of Pentagon investigations from January 2000 which show
36894,there are risks involved and soldiers must be informed that they must be particularly care
36895,"I therefore ask you to support Amendment No 33 by my group , but"
36896,"budgetary law , in particular , must not allow for large margins of discretion ."
36897,"I am not surprised that you , Mr Rapporteur , do not support A"
36898,the arguments you are putting forward here are the same as those you put forward in committee
36899,"Mr Modrow , this also applies to Cuba ."
36900,I welcome the fact that Cuba is approaching this process .
36901,"but for this to happen , a lot of change must take place in Cuba ."
36902,we are all familiar with the reports of Amnesty International .
36903,"it may be that you , as one of the last rulers of communism , see this"
36904,"nevertheless , this is an important criterion for the European Union ."
36905,"on the other hand , it is also fair , of course , that we offer assistance because of"

36911,in my opinion – and this brings me to a more personal part – it was right –
36912,"however , the position of the Committee on Agriculture is too protectionist in many parts ."
36913,"Turkey therefore has a long and difficult road ahead of it , and it will undoub"
36914,"our aim is to help Turkey on its way to becoming a free , democratic country"
36915,"the Council will have to ask itself whether it has not , by granting Turkey candidate status ,"
36916,damage is caused above all when hopes for accession have been aroused in Turkey
36917,the Islamic forces will surely turn such disappointment into political success !
36918,"Madam President , first of all I would like to say to those Members who are thanking"
36919,"we built the house , so we have to be grateful if mistakes have been made"
36920,but I am not here to praise anything .
36921,the room is very nice .
36922,I would like to point out the many errors .
36923,I very much welcome this reinstatement and would also like to stress that the Commission 's
36924,"as you know , the Commission will present an amending letter to the preliminary draft for"
36925,I think that one of the illusions that we must stripping off is the role of
36926,"the European Union has played a pathetic role in this crisis , divided , incapable"
36927,"not least for this reason , it is important that the European Union commits itself in the post"
36928,but that the Europeans have failed is obvious !
36929,when will Europeans finally learn that they will only be heard in the world if they speak with
36930,"Madam President , where is the journey going in Europe ?"
36931,"to a European federal state with a strong centre and far-reaching competences , or is"
36932,"following the text of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , it almost seemed as if the"
36933,"even for an enthusiastic European , that would be a distorted picture ."
36934,the classical swine fever is one of the scourges of the wildlife in Europe
36935,"the viral disease in pigs , which is harmless to humans , may recur"
36936,"let us not let this gentleman get away with it , but let us ensure that we stop"
36937,I call on everyone to do so .
36938,this is our common duty for a good future of our European continent .
36939,I would also like to mention Mr Seppänen .
36940,he had the historic task of presenting the report on the last budget of the European Coal
36941,"the size of the European budget , namely the EU budgetary quota , can also be describe"
36942,the budget 's share of European gross national product for next year is lower than it was in
36943,it will be only 1.03 % of European gross national product .
36944,the EU budget is thus 4.6 billion euros below the amount envisaged in
36945,"EUR 4.6 billion , which is almost 5 % of the total budget , or"
36946,"fourthly , it seems to me that , in addition to the measures envisaged"
36947,I am also referring to what Mr Swoboda has already said about additional rules for tunnel
36948,"in many parts of Europe , agriculture is to be strengthened and guided towards sustainable"
36949,I urge that we ensure that food safety is maintained .
36950,consumer confidence and the quality of agricultural products are important principles in today ’ s
36951,I believe it is important that this mid-term review is not used as an opportunity to call
36952,"we therefore need to not only think about Article 202 , but also change it"
36953,I would have expected more courageous words from the Presidency today .
36954,"these courageous words must be pronounced in Copenhagen at the latest , clear words to make"
36955,Parliament is repeatedly called upon to ensure that it is possible to adopt legislation quickly and
36956,"this is affirmed , but then I can only make the following recommendation to the Council"
36957,take Parliament 's arguments seriously !
36958,"there will be discussions , serious disputes , and we do not want to have a black"
36959,Copenhagen is therefore a good opportunity to set a signal for Article 202 .
36960,the democratic contacts at local level were supplemented by 80 municipalities following the last

36962,"Mr President , the clear language of the Zimbabwe resolution leaves no doubt that we hold President"
36963,"unfortunately , it is resistant to proposals from its own country , but also from"

36966,"for the years 1997 and 1998 , the total amount involved"
36967,this financial correction was contested by the Irish authorities in the so-called

36969,the Commission 's position in this case is that the Irish authorities have so far not provided
36970,I said that the Council has not seriously taken up this issue so far .
36971,governments are showing a fairly lack of interest in this issue .
36972,it is therefore not a bad idea to say that the entry into force of this statute
36973,this would ensure that the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference would deal with this issue
36974,you do not become an anti-fascist here if you denounce a democratically e
36975,"on the contrary , they ridicule the true victims of National Socialism and trivia"
36976,"you act on your own prejudices , renouncing any political confrontation and acting in"
36977,"the attack on the new Austrian government , the attempt to influence a Member State politically ,"
36978,we are therefore grateful for the Commission 's special attitude .
36979,"secondly , a system of traceability of food ingredients to their origin must be established for all"
36980,this principle must be consistently maintained in the planned revision of the Community labelling
36981,this is the only way to regain the lost confidence of consumers in food production .
36982,"I think that this is an honest and also a right step , because otherwise we lose"
36983,"above all , however , we must jointly fight those who make extreme profits from human"
36984,Mrs Díez González has spoken of the Spanish Presidency 's drumming .
36985,probably this is true for all of us because of the drum whirl we make here and
36986,"however , if we look at what the European Union has done in concrete terms to combat this traffic"
36987,some Members of this House have been to Bucharest with national parliamentarians and have

36989,"worse , however , is that it is only now that we are slowly starting to establi"
36990,I believe that the citizens of Europe expect a positive immigration policy to be pursued
36991,"that is why we must be very careful , but also very strict , in asking all"
36992,"we must not allow them to fall for this terrible idea of holding a referendum and then ,"
36993,that cannot be .
36994,"we , Hannes Swoboda , Joost Lagendijk and myself , will try tomo"
36995,I also believe that it is very important that an amnesty be granted – by whomever
36996,I think we have to make a fine distinction here .
36997,I would of course very much like Parliament to put in place as soon as possible all the law
36998,"I believe that if they continue along this path , as John said , we can have peaceful situation"
36999,the procedure must ensure that as many Members as possible can contribute to the group 's
37000,exceptions to this must only be made in truly urgent cases .
37001,Mrs Sbarbati is right to call for the Commission to support the proposal to limit compulso
37002,I supplement it with experiences from Germany .
37003,"the early retirement schemes , initially well-intentioned by politicians , have"
37004,"they were paid – the whole company was involved – older workers left , but younger workers"
37005,"if we talk about finances , people who retire from working life are entitled to a"
37006,"despite the diversity of national pension systems in Europe , they must be pay-related"
37007,"I voted against the resolution because paragraph 21 was adopted here , which calls on"
37008,this text is an ideal carte blanche for the practical closure of the European Parliament'
37009,let me give you a small example .
37010,it is Amendment No 34 . Halones are very dangerous .
37011,HCFCs are far less dangerous in terms of depleting the ozone layer .
37012,but it would still be insane to replace a dangerous substance with a less dangerous
37013,we just need to produce this less dangerous substance in sufficient quantities .
37014,then we have the same potential for damage .
37015,let us finally understand that this is the wrong way to go !
37016,Halones cannot be replaced by HCFCs in fire protection systems !
37017,"there are several substitutes in natural gases , nitrogen argon , inert ."
37018,"Austria has a very , very valuable library , the Austrian National Library ."
37019,we have a fire protection facility there that does not use all these dangerous substances .
37020,"we , the EPP , are against European maximum standards ."
37021,"in Germany , the framework is filled by legislative acts of the social partners ."
37022,"there are German standards , work and safety scaffolding ."
37023,"there are statutes as the legislative rights of the professional cooperatives , and then comes the"
37024,"incidentally , one can also criticise many of the practical regulations that go into"
37025,"but I tell you , one millimeter of such practical regulations is more important to the"
37026,"in 1996 , we noticed that our air quality measurements had not de"

37028,"a study was therefore prepared , and this study was carried out by the Technical University"
37029,the accuracy of the results has been significantly increased and the results have also been published
37030,I would also like to agree with Mr Lipietz when he says that in Paraguay it is
37031,we have no problem with each other .
37032,"but of course , you cannot write a book in a short resolution ."
37033,I hope that we will deal with this question elsewhere and I assume that we will

37038,"this has nothing to do with national special interests , but with contributing to an open and"
37039,the third challenge is that we must combat the causes of such disasters .
37040,I am well aware that we cannot simply say that the increase in greenhouse gases caused

37042,we just can ’ t say for sure yet .
37043,but all scientific bodies agree that such disasters will increase dramatically if we as industrialized

37046,"however , there have clearly been problems in the practical application of the Steel Code in recent"
37047,"from Parliament 's point of view , it is important that we are already talking about a follow"
37048,a weakening of the existing basic guidelines of the Steel Code must not be decided
37049,no one wants an unbridled subsidy race in Europe .
37050,"this would have a significant impact on the internal market , even after the consolidation of the steel"
37051,Parliament therefore considers it necessary that the steel subsidy code be amended in
37052,"with this gradual , cautious opening , we would finally have a genuine common network in"
37053,in order to ensure that railway companies from all Member States have effective access to the subnets
37054,the practice of the past 40 years has shown that the failure to separate network and
37055,the European Union is increasingly assuming responsibility in the world .
37056,this is clearly reflected in the European budget .

37067,we should be proud to say that we spend three times as much money from the European Union budget

37086,"we have no longer tabled the famous Nistico motion , which we have had a great"
37087,the main reason is that there were very serious problems in the Council with individual areas of this proposal
37088,I still do not understand why the Council could not approach this proposal .
37089,the European Parliament wanted to go further than the common position .
37090,"however , when I now hear that the Council is starting to discuss ethics on the basis of"

37106,"I would like to thank the draftsmen of the opinions , Mrs Theorin and Mr"
37107,many of their suggestions have been included in both reports of the Committee on Employment

37112,it is deeply regrettable that there have been communication problems and that Mr Smidt was
37113,but I insist that there is no connection whatsoever between this and fisheries reform .
37114,we must not have any illusions about culture either .

37117,"Mr President , two short supplementary questions ."
37118,"firstly , has the Council been in contact with President Mashadov , who was democratically"
37119,"according to the Rules of Procedure , it is his sole decision , but he has"
37120,now something else that is surprising : the basis for the Constitution was a preamble that
37121,I think the parallels between then and now are quite amazing .
37122,the arguments of the sceptics then and today - as one can see from history -
37123,let us learn from history so that we do not have to wait for decades before Europe is
37124,we need to prepare it for the future .
37125,"as regards the remaining problems in the European security and defence policy , I called on"
37126,"in any case , this problem should be resolved before the European Council in Laeken in December"
37127,I would also like to raise the issue of fundamental rights .
37128,I think that the Cologne decision to draw up a Charter of Fundamental Rights is of extreme
37129,"however , this has limited legal effect ."
37130,"in the long term , we must ensure that citizens also have rights under fundamental rights at European level"
37131,"but the decisive point in what has now been proposed in Cologne is the method ,"
37132,"firstly , it is about a correct calculation of the number of trips ."
37133,"here , doubts are expressed from various sides about the accuracy of the statistic"
37134,it is therefore necessary to ensure that the number of journeys is correctly calculated
37135,"to this end , it is necessary that Croatia also take those measures which concern the property"
37136,but it is also essential that the Republika Srpska in particular does its part .
37137,there is an agreement between the Croatian Foreign Minister and the former Prime Minister or President of the Republika

37151,"in the Caveri report , we propose – and that is what is so great about the report"

37154,we are meeting the interests of your population !
37155,"what you are doing here , namely , creating a pop-up that the rest of"
37156,so what connects us ?
37157,what enables us to live together ?
37158,the answer may seem fragile to some .
37159,"I believe that it is , nevertheless , all we have : democracy and human rights ."
37160,this is the unity of Europe .
37161,"whatever questionable things have come out of this continent , democracy and human rights are a message"
37162,"after the twentieth century , the century of great horrors and ultimate crimes , this"
37163,the dignity of the human being is inviolable !

37204,we urgently need to take a step in this direction in order to establish credibility
37205,these are things that I am not mentioning because I or my group are against liberalisation .
37206,but these are things we mention because we want to carry out liberalisation in the interests
37207,I have been able to give you a detailed account of the many actions that the Commission has
37208,"the Commission attaches the utmost importance to Parliament 's resolution on this report , which is"
37209,the draft resolution generally encourages the Commission to continue with its efforts .
37210,I would like to thank the rapporteur in particular for his good cooperation with the Commission .

37223,not every progress that humans achieve is also a progress for humanity .
37224,then there was the Declaration of the Eight .
37225,"on behalf of our group , I would like to say that we regret the procedure , which"
37226,but the substance of the declaration is something we can agree to .
37227,it was also necessary to send a signal of friendship to our American partners .
37228,my idea of the European agricultural model has not changed for years .
37229,I would like to see farmers in the European Union continue to fulfil this dual mission :
37230,I therefore believe that in the agricultural policy debate we should now really make sure that
37231,a very short question at the end :

37233,perhaps you can comment on that .
37234,I did not support your proposals for anti-group measures either .
37235,"when it comes to refugees , there are different measures than when it comes to displaced"
37236,"you cannot demand that displaced persons , whose first concern is to return to their home"
37237,this contradicts the basic intention .
37238,you can see how necessary this is from the letter that many of us – I think more
37239,"it criticised not only the Council 's procedure , but also the content itself ."
37240,I would therefore like to urge the Council to do everything possible in future to ensure that
37241,we have come closer to each other in the meantime .
37242,I said that the decision not to grant an exemption can be defended .
37243,"what we need , however , is a national fixed book price system that also works ."
37244,I am very grateful that you accept that we need rules for export and reimport .
37245,it is basically a general principle of law that a legal situation cannot be circumvented .
37246,"what we also need , however , are rules for imports ."
37247,that is the crucial point that we still have to discuss .

37300,and for me there is only one consequence from this disaster :
37301,"we must finally admit that , after the end of the Cold War , we are still rear"
37302,there are other issues where we do not have this consensus .

37305,"if it is indeed the case that Iraq poses a major danger , then it is only"

37352,"what is the purpose of this action , which we are supporting with Verve ?"
37353,we want to make our fellow citizens aware of the benefits of knowing several languages .
37354,"the different languages are part of cultural diversity , and the whole wealth of our culture is"

37379,I must say clearly that in the past we have expected a lot from the candidate countries

37392,I really ask my fellow Members to adopt a moratorium on this issue .
37393,we are in the process of taking up the request for the enhancement of Friday .
37394,the best way to enhance it would of course have been to vote on the important Buitenweg
37395,but I think Mrs Buitenweg cannot be here today .
37396,"regardless of this , however , we must upgrade Friday ."
37397,we are making the necessary arrangements in our group .

37407,the proposal also provides for an increase in certain financial contributions from the Financial Instrument for Fisheries

37411,"I find formulations such as the headline ‘ Different countries , same interests ’"
37412,the agendas are actually too different .
37413,it has been said that we have countries with a prospect of accession and others without .
37414,"we can , for example , demand much more in the area of human rights from neighbour"

37418,but the communication almost gives the impression that we are offering a Europe à la carte .

37431,I do not hide that many Members would have preferred to wait until we have a report from

37433,we ask the governments to follow this proposal from the Portuguese Presidency .
37434,"in this respect , there is a certain amount of confidence , and we very much hope that"

37446,I mention this because we are no longer able to speak to people in a way that they understand
37447,we can be proud of this directive .
37448,"it is a joint work by the European Parliament , which took the initiative , and the Commission"
37449,we can also be grateful to the Council for having accepted the proposal in general terms .
37450,the position we have taken and which we have always defended over the past six years and beyond
37451,that is why I also find the Council 's statement a little too meagre .
37452,"but our motion for a resolution , which I will come back to later , which we are"
37453,"from what I have heard , I am convinced that the Belgian Presidency will do so"
37454,"I would , however , like to make a major request to the Commission based on practical experience"
37455,many SMEs do not know at all - or it is very difficult for them to find

37467,"my question to the French Presidency is how it intends to handle this , whether it will"
37468,it was not even about a lot of money .
37469,the share of the European budget spent on culture is a mere 0.04 %

37484,"we want to continue , accelerate and complement the successful European path towards growth and employment"
37485,"the left in this House does not want to continue along this path , but rather dramatizes it"
37486,"state intervention has still led to higher debt , and higher debt has still harmed"
37487,"yes , you especially !"
37488,but every government has the right to be judged not by its words but by its deeds
37489,"in Copenhagen , the current Turkish government will have been in office for just six weeks ."
37490,give them a little more time so that they can be judged by their deeds .
37491,we have clarified this in this report and say : let us set up the chamber at the

37515,fundamental rights are essentially rights to defend against the state .
37516,is it not bizarre that it is the Heads of State or Government who are to decide
37517,who is to be surprised if these Heads of Government refuse to submit to the Charter
37518,the Council 's claim to power is the biggest problem in the actual constitutional process and is

37537,"I would also like to thank the Commissioner very warmly , because this is an important forward-"
37538,that means that we must raise our voices when human rights are violated .
37539,I will give a very concrete example : Chechnya .
37540,we must not turn a blind eye to what is happening in Chechnya just because we
37541,we cannot allow this to happen !
37542,the international exhaustion of trademark rights has been a subject of intense debate in recent months
37543,the exhaustion of trademark rights applies to all branded products .

37562,late payment is also a breach of contract if it is committed by the Commission !
37563,"this is not part of this directive , but my experience as a Member of Parliament is that"
37564,I believe that support measures should also be used to promote sustainability in rural areas and
37565,"in conclusion , I would like to thank you once again for your contributions ."
37566,"I believe that if there are new urgent needs – and in view of the BSE crisis ,"
37567,farmers do not know how much and which raw material is contained in the feed batches

37598,"research , by the way , cannot be carried out with the mind of accountants ."
37599,"research means risks - financial risks , by the way ."
37600,what is decisive is what comes out of it .
37601,"the result is decisive , not necessarily always the settlement ."
37602,"I would rather have a successful project , where you may have lost money , than a complete settlement"

37706,why are the other fishing nations not joining in ?
37707,are they not wanted ?
37708,where is the community ?
37709,"therefore , I would like to point out once again :"
37710,"last week in plenary I pointed out that , according to our Rules of Proce"
37711,this must also be done with the joint committees in third countries .
37712,"in this context , it is of course strange that the Member States , but also the Commission"

37778,I believe that a court should be established to monitor OLAF .
37779,the only court that can reasonably do that would be the Court of First Instance .

37840,I think it is right that Mrs van den Burg has taken a very open approach in her report

37843,I therefore believe that this report provides us with a good basis for dialogue with the other institutions
37844,I would like to mention one last area : further education .
37845,there have been some debates in our committee as to whether it is useful to call for a

37847,I am convinced that we will have this in four or five years .
37848,why should Parliament not even be a pioneer ?

37850,"in Germany alone , the estimated job loss due to this amateurism is 10"
37851,"by the way , these are not figures that I have invented or that come from any"
37852,"in the EU as a whole , another 15 000 jobs are expected"
37853,"well , ladies and gentlemen , this is a difficult task , UNMIK should do it"
37854,I do not believe that we can achieve all this only by installing democracy .
37855,"we must do this , but the first necessity is that we create jobs , that we create"
37856,"then we will be on the right track , and here too Mr Kouchner should be able to"
37857,"they no longer have national control , they no longer have European control …"
37858,because we know that security is much more comprehensive .

37860,"in this respect , a preventive conflict management is not reduced to the establishment of"
37861,"as regards the last point , namely transparency , our group has already made it clear"
37862,this Parliament stands for transparency and will continue to demand it from both the Council and the

37864,"nevertheless , our group does not place party political interests above the interests of the"
37865,"but there are still questions , serious doubts , about some of the Commissioners-designate"

37868,"the hearings , which are an important contribution to greater transparency and openness ,"
37869,critics should bear in mind that there is nothing comparable at the national level .
37870,"we can see that electronic mail , electronic business , will become enormously important in the future ."
37871,I also see a particular strength for the existing post in this .

37879,I congratulate the Commission on having now joined this Anti-Doping Agency and on

37881,I would like to come to today 's point .
37882,"the question now is , what is the situation in Kosovo ?"

37894,"however , where acts and statements are concerned , where the political context is already very"
37895,immunity is then in danger of becoming a privilege .
37896,even a court of law does not simply apply law in such cases .
37897,"it creates , shapes and develops law ."

37899,"and we do this by making a demarcation , a boundary drawing from oursel"
37900,"Mr President , I am sorry to have to return to my previous intervention ."
37901,thank you very much for quoting the article exactly as it was invoked .
37902,"like Mr Wieland , however , I am of the opinion that this article refers to other"
37903,and then there is the possibility : the President 's proposal .
37904,I really wanted to know whether that was the President 's proposal this morning and whether it was
37905,we must be aware of one thing : the Rules of Procedure make it deliberate
37906,"there are deliberate obstacles to this and , as we must see quite clearly , there"
37907,"for example , if the Conference of Presidents decides that there should be no debate on a"
37908,these are therefore well-considered rights to act against a momentary majority .
37909,there are deliberately these hurdles .
37910,the only exception is “ proposal by the President ” .
37911,here the question also arises whether it is so correct .
37912,"I therefore ask you to clarify whether , firstly , it was the President 's"
37913,"thirdly , I doubt that this is a sufficient legal basis for this procedure ."
37914,we will only be able to achieve all that I have talked about so far in the long
37915,"I do not need to mention the stability of political , economic and security policy that is link"
37916,the Commission notes with approval the statement by the Secretary-General of the United Nations that the
37917,the Commission is also ready to support any further efforts in this regard .
37918,"the Commission encourages all parties concerned , including Turkey in particular , to work towards a solution"
37919,the concept originated in the area of the internal market .
37920,it is based on mutual trust in the different systems of the Member States and on some common

37922,"but for me it is also important to question the so-called fair play , which always"
37923,"racism , doping , athletes as commodities - I believe these things have very much"
37924,"similarly , women in sport should be given new attention and work on their status here too"
37925,this also underlines our demand that the associations - contrary to the initial proposals -
37926,six hundred thousand sports clubs with their thousands of officials make a very important and
37927,"to achieve these objectives , and this is logical , competition must not stop at national"
37928,it must be designed for the whole Community .
37929,only then will the railway become a real alternative .
37930,"it is a great success for Parliament that this objective was achieved , albeit with transition"
37931,what applies to freight transport must also apply to passenger transport .
37932,the problems that result from the other modes of transport – for example road transport – are not
37933,embryonic stem cell research also involves the destruction of embryos .
37934,this is also basically about therapeutic cloning .
37935,we must therefore send a clear signal today that we do not want a society in which women
37936,"with adult stem cell research , we have a clear alternative to embryonic stem cell research ,"
37937,"in the case of patenting , too , we must expect the Commission to put a clear end"
37938,human life is not created by third parties .
37939,we therefore need a very clear signal from this point of view .
37940,Europe must not be an ethical minefield .
37941,we need clear ethical boundaries .
37942,"we must not have any loopholes in the law , and human dignity must clearly"
37943,the Albanian population and its representatives must have the greatest interest in ensuring that these

37945,we are absolutely opposed to violent changes in states and violent changes in borders .
37946,"it is the elected representatives of the governments and parliaments , of the Albanian and"
37947,"we must , however , be clear and unequivocal in our rejection of the violent"

37951,I am grateful for the President-in-Office 's frank words in this area
37952,"but , and I would like to agree with some of the previous speakers , the problem we"
37953,let us take a look at ourselves in the European Union !
37954,where is the enthusiasm for the reform of the institutions ?
37955,where is the willingness to reform agricultural policy ?
37956,where is the courage to reform the Structural Funds ?
37957,where is the courage to tell the people that the acquis must be abandoned in order to
37958,where is the openness to admit that reforms sometimes hurt ?
37959,"we 25 must find new ways together , and I am convinced that it is not"
37960,"just because the Union is too inert to shape this historic process , we must not blame"
37961,"that is why we must also ensure that changes take place here , and I am convinced that"
37962,"if Latvia becomes a member of the European Union , if its enthusiastic young population"
37963,I am quite optimistic .
37964,"even though the acceptance of the euro among the population has increased , it must be stated"
37965,"however , this development was foreseeable and should not be overly negatively assessed ."
37966,the increasing acceptance of the euro among the population is a process and does not in any way
37967,"as regards cash withdrawals from ATMs , I support the rapporteur ’ s view"
37968,I believe that the debate here has shown how valuable the Court of Auditors ' special

37970,"first of all , money ."
37971,I believe - and no one will be surprised - that in the final phase of a nego
37972,"that is completely normal , and I wouldn ’ t be particularly upset about it !"
37973,we know that UMTS is bringing us a new service .
37974,the environment and the telecommunications sector will play a very special role in the future
37975,that is why I think it is important to develop fair framework conditions .
37976,this directive in particular shows that fairness has been explored and is an exemplary process
37977,"in this case , I feel similar to many others ."
37978,"I also feel very repulsed by the thought that embryos are being manipulated , research"
37979,there are certainly limits .
37980,"but practical experience shows me that in the end , you may not be able to do much"
37981,we have no need to act at the moment .
37982,we have time .
37983,we should consider very carefully how we are going to deal with this matter .
37984,"we have committees for this , and sometimes it is also useful to read a good book ."
37985,"this is largely due to the Structural Funds , even though the gap between the"
37986,the use of European structural funds has already brought about a rapprochement of living conditions .
37987,the gap in average GDP over ten years has decreased by 10 % .
37988,the four cohesion countries and the five new German states are particularly affected here –
37989,I believe that it is in the interests of consideration and respect for the other Member States
37990,"it is about creating a common area of security , stability and peace , and this includes"
37991,when Tunisian officials repeatedly emphasise that this also involves combating extremism
37992,but how else than through democracy can this fight be best waged ?
37993,Tunisia ’ s neighbours are also a good example .
37994,"Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am not sure what the Commission is"
37995,creating a space for lifelong learning means taking active action to guarantee equal opportunities for all
37996,"Realistically speaking , the European Union cannot do this alone , when we see that"
37997,"there , too , something needs to be changed ."
37998,"in addition , there is often petty fear from the Member States , for example from the German"
37999,"there is no king 's way in drug policy , we all agree ."
38000,but consequences must also follow .
38001,"the primary objective must be harm reduction , and this must be firmly anchor"
38002,"I will show what this means in concrete terms in four demands , with which I will then"
38003,I should now like to refer specifically to the issue of the necessary expenditure for
38004,he was also one of the most important speakers in today 's debate .
38005,the Commission has drawn the conclusions for the priorities in the 2001
38006,several speakers have pointed out that the Commission is called upon to do so .
38007,"in your decision of 16 December , you also asked the Commission and the Council to do"
38008,the Commission is called upon to present concrete estimates of the resources required in April and then also
38009,"if it were a different person , if it were a country that is not in the electoral campaign"
38010,that is why we reject these attempts to influence the electoral campaign in Italy and the dem
38011,"Madam President , I would like to respond very briefly to what Mr Poettering said ."
38012,"in principle , we have a similar attitude ."
38013,I would just like to draw attention to the fact that if we strictly enforce this principle
38014,I would ask Mr Poettering to work in his group to ensure that the committees can come
38015,"but as a baseline for the next time , this is quite reasonable ."
38016,"especially today , when a student or employee wants to become self-employed , we"
38017,the so-called one man start up is a very important concern .
38018,it must also be possible to provide venture capital tranches of EUR 5 00
38019,"the five priorities you have named and set are not only politically logical , but"
38020,"the list does not sound sensational , but as you have heard from the speeches here in"
38021,it is good that we are now transferring this part of the transitional civil administration within the

38023,"Heidi Hautala – We have already worked well together in recent days , and one expression of"
38024,let us continue to work in this spirit of openness and in this atmosphere of fairness
38025,"I wish you , Madam President , and all of us , that ."
38026,another important point : we do not want to see a separate structure for the ECSC after the
38027,"this is also what the Commission is proposing , and we support it afterwards ."
38028,"each separate structure creates additional costs without added value , and we should rather form a specialist"

38030,are you confident that the decisions taken by the European Council will then be implemented via

38032,that is 60 % who do not know how we are dealing with the sums

38034,"there are enormous sums of money being spent on this , and I believe that the"
