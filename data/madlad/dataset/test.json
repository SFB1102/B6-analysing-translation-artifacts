{"sentence":"I very much regret that we are not able to have a Parliamentary resolution on this subject .","label":0}

{"sentence":"Mrs Langenhagen , you spoke so beautifully of a praline , and Mr Sava","label":1}
{"sentence":"I must also say clearly that the Commission is not in a position to take any responsibility","label":1}
{"sentence":"this applies both to the content and the financial aspects .","label":1}
{"sentence":"he was a highly valued if not slightly boring member , who tried to prevent us going too far in our recommendations and acted as a brake on some of us who were more enthusiastic about pushing forward .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the idea set out in the report of the Committee of Wise Men for the establishment of the internal audit service in the way that they described it represents in my view and the view of my colleagues a significant step ahead .","label":0}

{"sentence":"guaranteeing a regular budget for these NGOs is the best way to support their activities and increase their effectiveness and efforts in creating a generation of young people that will become more socially involved .","label":0}

{"sentence":"I am very pleased the Committee on Budgets has accepted our point of view and I hope the Commission does as well .","label":0}
{"sentence":"they would be well advised to recognise the weight of political and public opinion that propels the change and has given rise to the circumstances that now starkly confront the institution that I represent and indeed all of the European institutions .","label":0}

{"sentence":"this time the judgement on the 2000 financial management is rather mild ,","label":1}

{"sentence":"I am perfectly well aware of the views and advice of our head of the delegation in Khartoum and that certainly indicates that the dialogue that we are in the middle of is making some progress .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the result of that ' boldness ' was a botched privatisation that caused absolute chaos in the railway industry and has caused the present government to spend a lot more money on the railways than was planned .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we are also ready to provide technical assistance .","label":0}
{"sentence":"certain people criticised that report because it was far too technical .","label":0}

{"sentence":"therefore the Commission invites all Members of Parliament who have expressed an opinion contrary to that of the Commission to reconsider their position on this issue very carefully before tomorrow 's vote .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the Commission has committed itself to this task , and the draft for the entire package of","label":1}

{"sentence":"so I cannot comment on that .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we are not in the business of creating a European Army .","label":0}
{"sentence":"no 7 is superfluous because the decision already contains provisions on a regular follow-up of how objectives are achieved .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we should encourage further development of this area , in particular for those who are disadvantaged .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I might also add that the outbreak of classical swine fever in the Netherlands in 1997 was also caused by the feeding of pigswill in neighbouring Germany .","label":0}

{"sentence":"not all the decisions taken at the Berlin Summit were as forward-looking as we had","label":1}

{"sentence":"at its meeting yesterday , the United Nations Security Council pointed the right way .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we all know what those prisoners are suffering .","label":0}

{"sentence":"but as wandering small parts they are a problem .","label":1}

{"sentence":"I believe that everyone in Europe has recognised that this is a high priority and that","label":1}

{"sentence":"the report refers to the importance of involving young people themselves in the campaign to prevent alcohol abuse , so that the right , positive images and the right messages are used , which will reach young people and which will have an influence on them .","label":0}
{"sentence":"why not reveal the questions to the public , why not to the petitioners ?","label":0}
{"sentence":"it has been a matter of considerable regret and more to many of us that Russian behaviour in the last few weeks and months in Chechnya has stretched and strained our attempts to create that sort of relationship almost to breaking point .","label":0}
{"sentence":"but we have no possibility at all of implementing this , even in an initial stage .","label":1}

{"sentence":"I hope that the debate is over so that I can answer any question that I may have forgotten .","label":0}
{"sentence":"now it depends on how efficient the cooperation among all the interested parties will be","label":1}
{"sentence":"the Tories , on the other hand , offer nothing but rising crime and falling investment .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this misses two goals : giving them protection and catching the trafficking gangs .","label":0}

{"sentence":"it is not entirely appropriate in my view to move from the arguments of substance for and against a marketing ban to a much more convoluted and esoteric debate about WTO law .","label":0}
{"sentence":"it has been well documented that air transport is a very safe mode of transport and this should , and must , remain the case .","label":0}

{"sentence":"the playing field between the richer and poorer countries is anything but level .","label":0}
{"sentence":"here , too , I would ask you to simply adopt the amendments that Parliament will adopt","label":1}
{"sentence":"for similar reasons , the Commission cannot accept the new Amendment No 22 which relates to the very important area of safety of navigation but is of no relevance to the proposed regulation .","label":0}

{"sentence":"I think it is worth noting that the Spanish fleet has a historic tradition of distant water fishing .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I too would like to thank Mrs Hoff for her very good report .","label":1}
{"sentence":"finally , as has already been said , it is essential , and I hope that the IGC will cover this , to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas , with democratic and judicial scrutiny .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the report is clear in its praise of the commitment and experience of most officials .","label":0}
{"sentence":"to date the action taken has not been satisfactory and the Commission remains very concerned about the situation .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we work in dangerous corners of the world , where even the best-trained professionals are exposed to risks .","label":0}
{"sentence":"immediate humanitarian help is one thing , but the demands upon us will certainly extend much beyond that .","label":0}
{"sentence":"despite the exertions thus far , the participants must be prepared for a sprint finish .","label":0}

{"sentence":"as a senior British trade union general secretary said , it is a significant step forward and offers a chance to build a substantial foundation .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we have proof of execution for two cases in the first half of 200","label":1}
{"sentence":"like Parliament , the Council has recognised that mandatory labelling should be introduced ear","label":1}
{"sentence":"I would therefore like to briefly address three political points that are important to me .","label":1}
{"sentence":"this is a research committee which has commissioned an extensive report on both the Sellafield plant and Cap La Hague plants , and it has raised fairly serious concerns about the emissions to air and water from both the Cap La Hague and the Sellafield plants .","label":0}
{"sentence":"in principle , fitting a car with tyres not capable of coping with its top speed could invalidate the conformity of the vehicle with the EU type approval .","label":0}
{"sentence":"since the death penalty has existed , people have tried to justify its necessity without success","label":1}
{"sentence":"in this sense , it is time for us all to call for constructive work on our own","label":1}
{"sentence":"however , there are two points that are very important to me for the future of the competition .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Mr President , these three reports generally give a strong endorsement of the function of the office of Ombudsman and also of its current incumbent and my group warmly congratulates Mr S\u00f6derman on his work .","label":0}
{"sentence":"in the report , the Commission also highlighted the central role of the European Anti-Fraud","label":1}
{"sentence":"that is the iron law that I have had to learn , whatever my occasional political reservations .","label":0}
{"sentence":"much of the debate here yesterday focused on the Irish people 's decision in relation to the Nice Treaty .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this House has to ensure that in those countries where we give aid we monitor the breakdown of law and order and look at the interests of those ethnic minorities who are in danger .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we know he has worked extremely hard on this report and very closely with others in this Chamber to ensure its success .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we need to be clear that the motivating force for this war is primarily about trying to ensure secure access to oil .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the new company law must turn employees from outsiders into members of the company .","label":1}
{"sentence":"lastly , the implications of these \u2018 concerns \u2019 in agri-environmental policies must be evaluated , particularly in social and economic terms , so as to not render the farming sector unviable .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the current draft agreements between the EU and the US on extradition and legal cooperation must not escape the parliamentary scrutiny provided for in our Treaties .","label":0}
{"sentence":"they must not be sacrificed to liberalisation under any circumstances .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I started the report by reminding you of the beauty of the European cultural landscape .","label":1}
{"sentence":"if you know anything specific about this , we will of course be happy to investigate it .","label":1}
{"sentence":"our group voted against the arms industry resolution because using more funds and resources to promote the arms industry in Europe goes against what the European Union should be about .","label":0}
{"sentence":"if we talk about a lack of female candidates , which we are very , very often","label":1}
{"sentence":"very little money filters down to the ordinary people who are amongst the poorest in the world in one of the poorest regions of the world .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Mr President , we are regularly reassured that the measures being put in place under the common European security and defence policy are intended to strengthen NATO .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the withdrawal option , as formulated in Mr Corbett 's Amendments Nos 3 , 10 and 11 , would effectively amount to replacing the freedom of adoption by the Commission by an explicit withdrawal or non-action by the Commission .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this report calls for some radical proposals such as the call to introduce a gradual ban on vessels of 20 years of age or over , which my colleague Mr Hudghton has just mentioned , except where they have passed stringent annual safety checks .","label":0}
{"sentence":"penalising people for using roads is an extremely dangerous step , yet this is exactly what the report advocates .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we can accept this point as we think that practice has shown that there are no excessive costs for these companies and that such an exemption is not needed , and it might even lead to market distortions .","label":0}
{"sentence":"firstly , I fully share the view expressed in the report that the negotiating directives to be given to the Commission must enable us to ensure that Albania will be in the position to implement all commitments it may undertake during negotiations .","label":0}
{"sentence":"and in the area of protein feed , in particular , we are dependent on imports from third countries","label":1}
{"sentence":"but it is also about questions of cooperation .","label":1}
{"sentence":"in this respect , we not only congratulate the rapporteur , but we also hope that","label":1}
{"sentence":"however , we should concentrate on the points that are truly of European interest and on the","label":1}
{"sentence":"do you want that ?","label":1}
{"sentence":"it is worthwhile to work for this .","label":1}
{"sentence":"that , of course , gives us a basis for democracy , human rights and good governance .","label":0}
{"sentence":"but , Mr Silva , non-Muslim states are also included .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the linguistic change in the new Commission proposal finally allows the Member States to adopt their own national","label":1}
{"sentence":"not least , the escalation in Kosovo marked the German Presidency of the Council .","label":1}

{"sentence":"but there are two important points to remember , which have been touched upon several times here today \u2013 and Mr Cunha has just raised them again .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the fact is , of course , that we are already more than half way through the preparatory period for these negotiations on EPAs , so these delays are rather difficult for the ACP to deal with ; they are delays that affect thousands of livelihoods in the ACP and so there is deep concern .","label":0}
{"sentence":"that is a reasonable remark .","label":0}

{"sentence":"the most important thing is that we want more transparency through labelling .","label":1}
{"sentence":"but what about the role of industry that profits from this piece of legislation not going through ?","label":0}

{"sentence":"there is a European Patent Convention and 15 Member States have signed the Convention but a number of other states have also signed it so the Commission cannot tell the European Patent Office what its language arrangements should be .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the question is how and where .","label":0}
{"sentence":"it has also been the source of tremendous disagreement between the fishermen , on one hand , and the scientists , on the other .","label":0}
{"sentence":"so there can be no more appropriate time for countries to be working together to confront these humanitarian challenges .","label":0}
