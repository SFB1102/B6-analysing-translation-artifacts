{"sentence":"the laws must be implemented so that the Albanian citizens also see that they really have something from these changes to the Constitution .","label":1}

{"sentence":"we should not underestimate just how steep , stony and difficult the path is going to be , but I do hope , for all our sakes , and for the world , that we can set off on the right foot and in the right direction .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I would also strongly argue that the principle of covering radiation pollution should be included too .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the second and fundamental principle is that any retention of ex ante control runs up against a crucial objection that de facto if not de jure , it displaces responsibility for financial irregularity from the person actually managing expenditure onto the person approving it .","label":0}
{"sentence":"nor , it seems , does the EPP believe that ethnic minorities should be encouraged to vote .","label":0}
{"sentence":"finally , before responding to the two amendments tabled by Mr Ferber , I must say that I heard Mr Miller 's comments on Mr Ferber 's amendments and think that , whatever glorious future offers itself to my good friend Mr Miller , I can safely predict that he will not be made head of the diplomatic service .","label":0}
{"sentence":"a factor will certainly be the introduction of the euro in the coming year .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the Kozloduy nuclear power plant accounts for half the internal power generation in Bulgaria .","label":0}
{"sentence":"it is in fact an integral part of our agreement policy and is also in all negotiation directives that the financial compensation for the granted fishing rights must be brought from the EU budget and from the shipowners .","label":1}
{"sentence":"of course , paragraph 13 records what was agreed , not what was not agreed .","label":0}
{"sentence":"right now , in the face of the brave demonstrations all over the country , we must show the Serbian people that they can count on the full support of the European Union in their democratisation .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I welcome the issues highlighted by Mr Busk and Mrs Attwooll in their respective reports .","label":0}
{"sentence":"let me say about Texaco that the Centre for Economic and Social Rights says that in Ecuador they are responsible for a high occurrence of abortion and abnormally high cancer rates .","label":0}
{"sentence":"these statements confirm the concerns expressed within my country that this Charter is intended to be the preamble to a European Constitution .","label":0}
{"sentence":"but let me start with the first .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we should not be distracted by that .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Madam President , ladies and gentlemen !","label":1}
{"sentence":"Mr President , my very esteemed ladies and gentlemen members of the House of Representatives !","label":1}
{"sentence":"we should , however , recognize from this example that it is not always only about the absolute power of authority .","label":1}
{"sentence":"it can contribute to education and lifelong learning , as well as promoting qualities of leadership , citizenship and teamwork .","label":0}
{"sentence":"three polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants are available on the market .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Mr President , if I had an hour instead of a minute I could maybe touch on some of the key points , however , in the European Parliament we have to work within these limits .","label":0}
{"sentence":"in passing , I would add that we have not come close to cracking the problem in Afghanistan , another country where regime change has proved rather more straightforward than building a pluralist nation .","label":0}
{"sentence":"following on from that , the report had to be written and evaluated and then discussed with the French authorities .","label":0}
{"sentence":"in truth , the support systems for the production of electricity from the sun , the wind , the biomass are only necessary because we are still subventing other energy forms directly or indirectly .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks dwindle and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports .","label":0}
{"sentence":"if we do not sell enlargement we are likely to run into difficulties with ratification .","label":0}
{"sentence":"therefore I do not belong to those who consider this summer as a unique phenomenon of this century .","label":1}
{"sentence":"therefore , I also believe that it is important to invest more in this group , so that we can fully agree with this proposal of 40 % here , and this share in primary and secondary schools .","label":1}
{"sentence":"first : in the sensitive Alpine region exceptions are justified .","label":1}
{"sentence":"this means that in this way we are able to use the leeway that has developed here and to help the under pressure cattle farmers , and at the same time to respect the Ceilings as they were decided in Berlin .","label":1}
{"sentence":"it is just not acceptable to spend at least 12 hours travelling here and miss a whole day 's work .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we have instead the amendment 58 , which is part of the compromise package with the Council .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I will submit a copy of the full text of the joint statement to the Secretariat .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I should like to acknowledge the understanding of the public and the level of cooperation between the authorities north and south of the border .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the first is the potentially detrimental effects on existing international funds , the CLC , i.e. the Convention on Civil Liability , and the IOPC , the International Oil-Pollution Compensation Fund .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the common regulation of the conditions under which members of third countries enjoy freedom of movement in the territory of the Member States is very to be welcomed .","label":1}
{"sentence":"in that way , faith could be restored in the process at the same time .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I am grateful for the active cooperation of the Commissioner 's services , but the results of my questionnaire \u2013 showing that non-state actor consultation took place in only half of 63 beneficiary countries and that the totals by region record only 2 or 3 % of the total funding provided going to non-state actors \u2013 represents a challenge for the time ahead .","label":0}
{"sentence":"it is in Wilnius just over ten years ago that this was the case .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the decoupling system that you have put forward , Commissioner , will help us with the WTO round .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the coherence of the 5th framework programme with the structural funds \u2013 the most sustainable instruments of our community \u2013 with the Community initiative EQUAL and the programmes DAPHNE , STOP , PHARE and MEDA is rightly demanded .","label":1}
{"sentence":"if this was the intention there would be no need to set up the separate structures which largely exclude the Americans and Canadians and marginalise reliable European allies such as Turkey .","label":0}
{"sentence":"at least two meetings a year , if not even three must take place .","label":1}
{"sentence":"and I am happy it can be debated by Parliament today .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I hope that the Commissioner will undertake a review of the timescale for preparing legislation to prevent problems of this sort , which I am sure are as disappointing to her as they are to us .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Madam President , I wanted to bring up the issue of a very important meeting which took place yesterday with Justice and Home Affairs ministers , where agreement was made in relation to people \u2019 s privacy and their right to privacy , their fundamental rights in access to telecommunications .","label":0}
{"sentence":"therefore , it also affects us in Europe very strongly .","label":1}
{"sentence":"you mentioned it .","label":1}
{"sentence":"about 450 000 jobs are lost in the EU every year .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Austria needs a proper solution , which is not given here .","label":1}

{"sentence":"Mr President , I would like to concentrate on research and the creation of the European research area , both through the framework programme and through coordination of national policies .","label":0}
{"sentence":"that is why , Mr President-in-Office , we need information from you as soon as possible about the attitude of the Council .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we have been dealing with these two draft directives of the Commission for a very long time now , for over a year and a half .","label":1}
{"sentence":"on the contrary , they have just contributed to the fact that the regions are drifting apart again , just these 14 selected projects , and they have contributed to a development trend in which economic activity in the prosperous economic regions is increasing because they have been connected , while the poor regions are being left further and further behind .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I 'm not sure if I understand the question .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the Commission will monitor future developments with the utmost attention to make sure that all parties act in respect for democratic principles and human rights , in conformity with the basic provisions of Article 1 of the EC-Nepal Cooperation Agreement .","label":0}
{"sentence":"so there is not any confusion or contradiction between any ad hoc view and the Scientific Steering Committee .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I would like to ask only a question .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we have managed to divert 400 million from the budget for the costs of foot and mouth disease this year .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Madam President !","label":1}
{"sentence":"but I think it would make you loved and admired in the long-run .","label":0}
{"sentence":"that proposal , which has been accepted by the Vietnamese side , aims to encourage and support the continued commitment of the Vietnamese Government on human rights issues .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this goes against all the international principles of basic human rights .","label":0}

{"sentence":"this is a duty that everyone fulfils .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we are showing that we are on the move with the people and not acting only when draft guidelines are on the table , but then when it is necessary , i.e. when it is time to raise our voice and initiate political action .","label":1}
{"sentence":"what strikes me most in these two budgets is the emergence of interinstitutional cooperation , which ten years ago was perhaps more of a wish than a practice .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we are accepting the fact , for example , that matching funding is often not provided by national governments and that , by clever accounting , figures are all too often shrouded and fudged .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very good report , which takes into account the Commission 's proposals and the supplementary measures of the Committee .","label":1}
{"sentence":"it is essential that we include the tracking of nuclear fuel information , and in particular subsidies for nuclear fuel and energy .","label":0}

{"sentence":"this is a really effective way to move forward .","label":1}
{"sentence":"such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing .","label":0}
{"sentence":"if I have misunderstood you , please let me know .","label":1}
{"sentence":"but the decision has been made , and I stand by it .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we can do that here , but not outside this room .","label":1}
{"sentence":"otherwise we can not guarantee that from the beginning the necessary tasks are fulfilled so that the extension is a success .","label":1}
{"sentence":"after the Commission has fulfilled at least a part of the conditions within the deadline and a personnel restart has been made by replacing the Secretary General of the Commission , I have requested a discharge in my follow-up report , but I have given the Commission the task of collecting the amounts from the Fl\u00e9chard and ECHO cases , which together amount to around 17 million ecu , for the EU budget .","label":1}
{"sentence":"amongst various troublesome aspects , I feel bound to highlight the \u201c ambiguous \u201d and supposedly \u201c neutral \u201d way in which the current situation on the Middle East is addressed , glossing over the Israeli Government \u2019 s considerable responsibility for the intolerable situation that exists in Palestine , due to its policy of terror and violence against the Palestinian people and their representatives , its illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories and its failure to comply with UN resolutions .","label":0}
{"sentence":"several proposals are already before the Council and Parliament : for example , the package of proposals recasting and updating the hygiene legislation .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I support progress .","label":0}

{"sentence":"the rapporteur , Mr Costa Neves , will no doubt make his remarks shortly .","label":1}
{"sentence":"for the reasons I have already put forward I must reject Amendments Nos 4 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 and 18 .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I would mention , by way of example , the good effort which is now being tried out in the funding of the oil pipeline in Chad .","label":0}

{"sentence":"the double strategy of cooperation and criticism developed by Mr Oostlander in his report is in line with the situation in Russia as seen by my group .","label":1}
{"sentence":"however , it also noted , with concern , continuing difficulties with regard to the restriction of freedoms , the use of executions and torture and discrimination directed against religious minorities and women .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I think you have raised an important point there .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Mr President , Mr Commissioner !","label":1}
{"sentence":"I therefore support the amendments which call for a punishment of the guilty , because the operation of vehicles , which is a risk source in itself and which brings with it a potential danger to people , must be followed up accordingly in a factual and professional manner and with the necessary care .","label":1}
