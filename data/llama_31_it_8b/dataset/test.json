{"sentence":"the whole approach of the common asylum policy is integral to the work of our committee and we are very much committed to it .","label":0}

{"sentence":"we have implemented many things despite the changed situation since the attacks in the US , without demanding dramatically higher expenses .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Mr. President of the Council , you spoke of Ghent .","label":1}

{"sentence":"Honorable President , distinguished colleagues !","label":1}
{"sentence":"we have all the trust in you , but be ambitious !","label":1}
{"sentence":"therefore , I would like to say clearly , these own competences , which colleague Lamassoure clearly outlines in his report , find our support , because we need better argued activities of the European Union in the interest of the security of our citizens both in foreign policy as well as regarding the area of freedom and security .","label":1}
{"sentence":"obviously everybody is looking into the detail now and although we were very excited when we first got the agreement , I think a lot of people would agree that it is going to be quite difficult to find out whether it is going to benefit some of the smaller clubs \u2013 in particular , academy clubs \u2013 as much as we hoped .","label":0}

{"sentence":"however , while these measures will hopefully contribute to improving the state of fishery resources , I am concerned that the Commission has not got it right in certain other areas : for example , in the recent report on the implementation of MAGPs and the drastic cuts that it calls for in some fleets which is of grave concern to Scots and other fishermen .","label":0}

{"sentence":"while sympathetic , the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments as they are currently formulated and therefore I have to reserve my position on this question for the time being .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this is such a legally contradictory system that it can only end up where it has always ended up before , in stagnation .","label":1}
{"sentence":"secondly , I am in favor of a implementing regulation that enables niche products from small producers to have a sufficient flexibility margin .","label":1}

{"sentence":"thirdly , it underlines the importance of engaging civil society and building parliamentary links .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the Commission will then have to investigate , as it does in the case of all other Member States , whether or not such measures are likely to distort intra-Community competition .","label":0}

{"sentence":"the Council therefore needs to look at the Treaty provisions to see how we can rationalise this area .","label":0}
{"sentence":"there would be no point in those impact assessments if MEPs in the European Parliament or Ministers in the Council of Ministers were then to ignore your assessment and simply revise the legislation without any regard for the impact .","label":0}

{"sentence":"even if the rules of procedure do not provide for it .","label":1}
{"sentence":"also to the rapporteur , Mr Wijkman , for fighting for sufficient resources to meet the challenge with our full support from the Socialist Group and , of course , to those governments in developing countries that have been prepared to challenge taboos and to patient groups in those and other countries who set an example of the sort of change of attitude required , both of whom prove that the battle against HIV \/ AIDS can be won .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this is the opportunity we have to seize .","label":0}
{"sentence":"on the treatment of taxes and social contributions , I agree with the rapporteur that this is a relevant way of doing the calculations and that we should take a favourable view of the criteria which the Commission intends to set because of the way in which priority is given .","label":0}
{"sentence":"it is a pity that the US has not lived up to its responsibilities .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I know that the Commissioner may say that this is a matter for the sporting families , but ultimately we will have to sort it out , because if the players ' associations either refuse to come on board or the players take action , then ultimately the agreement may be in tatters .","label":0}
{"sentence":"in 2002 , annual activity reports - specifically also on financial management - were submitted by all general directors for the first time .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the transparency is , incidentally , also in the interest of the ECB , because as a still relatively young institution , it is particularly dependent on creating and consolidating its legitimacy , credibility , and trustworthiness as a European authority .","label":1}
{"sentence":"another problem is clearly the fact that much of the scientific evidence on these matters is conflicting .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the rules on admission of third-country nationals for the purpose of employment , presented by the Commission in July 2001 , have now been complemented by a new proposal , presented in October , on the conditions for entry and residence for study purposes .","label":0}
