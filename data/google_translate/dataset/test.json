{"sentence":"however , this means that , conversely , we have to be ready to support Turkey in their reform process , as we do with all other candidates with much greater financial means .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I also remember Mr. Maat and Mr. Kindermann , who then worked in the compromise applications .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Mr President , the Commissioner 's commitment on this issue is not in doubt at all .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this will probably not be very simple , but in any case the political groups should be able to comment orally .","label":1}
{"sentence":"at the same time the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this is not a concern solely for Greece .","label":0}

{"sentence":"everyone is trying to leave these countries and go to other countries to New Zealand , America and Canada .","label":1}
{"sentence":"ultimately , about 20 % of our jobs in the European Union depend on this question .","label":1}

{"sentence":"this compromise can be accepted .","label":1}
{"sentence":"on the question of representativity , i.e. on the question of how many Member States representatives and representatives must be represented in parliaments or they must have achieved a certain election result , we believe that our proposal to the requirements is balanced , and we stand by it .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we need an acceleration of the decision -making process , not 28 months as with company pension schemes .","label":1}
{"sentence":"basically , I believe that such a broad compromise , supported by the four largest factions in this house , should not be questioned again by amendments .","label":1}
{"sentence":"third : we start with ourselves .","label":1}
{"sentence":"however , it is important to add that , in delivering the sort of benefits that Mr Miller was talking about , we need to reflect the fact that a lot of other improvements to the infrastructure associated with public transport will also be needed .","label":0}

{"sentence":"cases such as Enron or Maxwell must not happen .","label":1}
{"sentence":"all the while they do not do so , the European Union is the loser .","label":0}

{"sentence":"it is particularly unfortunate - and the colleague Imbeni has already mentioned this - that the development and handling of the projects through partners , around 56 % of whom are non -governmental organizations , is not sufficiently presented in public as the help of the European Union .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the fundamental rights chart should become part of a future European constitutional contract - not a constitution - so that the European Union is not a state , not a nation state , but the European Union goes its own way .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we decided to help the Albanians because the basic and human rights were violated .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we have been very impressed by the positive way in which the Chinese authorities , led , I repeat by Mr Zhu Rongji , have responded to our own ideas , and I hope that we will have in place shortly some viable programmes in areas such as information and training , which will help to deal with a very serious problem for China and for us as well .","label":0}

{"sentence":"this is really a point I would like to address to the Council , not that there is much point in doing it here this evening , but the Member States cannot have it both ways .","label":0}
{"sentence":"because then Europe moved together on the way to the space of freedom , security and the right .","label":1}
{"sentence":"there were often delays in the negotiations due to the work of processing at the Commission and due to overly long response times , which were sometimes due to newly placed requirements on the part of the Commission .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the evaluation commissioned by the Authority cannot address the whole regulation , as it can only be relevant to the Authority .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we know how hard the competition is particularly in road traffic , and in our eyes these regulating measures were of the greatest importance .","label":1}

{"sentence":"I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world .","label":0}
