{"sentence":"this would enable Latvia to receive more European funding .","label":1}

{"sentence":"the Council did not fulfill its responsibility to implement what it had itself decided in Article 19 , namely to issue the implementing provisions as of 1.1.2000 .","label":1}
{"sentence":"war can never be the solution in situations like this .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I join with you in congratulating and thanking both rapporteurs , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mrs Myller , for their efforts , but I would also like to thank the President of Parliament 's delegation , Mr Friedrich , for his role in bringing these negotiations to a successful conclusion \u2013 unfortunately he cannot be here this evening \u2013 and Mr Provan for stepping in at the last moment in what proved to be one of the finest evenings of the summer .","label":0}

{"sentence":"it upsets these people , and above all it upsets the most important opinion leaders in these countries .","label":1}
