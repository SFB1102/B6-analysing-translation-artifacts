{"sentence":"after all , since most of them have rejected the ghastly communist experiment that so distorted and corrupted their countries for the past 50 years , I hope they would wish to oppose inappropriate intrusion on their national sovereignty and the tide of leftist political correctness that is too often generated by European Union institutions .","label":0}
{"sentence":"yet the Commission is not tackling this head on .","label":0}
{"sentence":"in my opinion , financial transparency and state funding must be transparent so it can be discussed tomorrow during voting because this is essential for fair competition among ports .","label":1}

{"sentence":"Mr President , my very honorable members of parliament !","label":1}
{"sentence":"this authority would have responsibility for scientific evidence and the communication and management of all risks relating to food safety .","label":0}
{"sentence":"therefore the Commission has no opinion on them .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we are always very reactionary and talk about things that we really cannot affect .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I hope that also the Council will make this leap and issue these statements because for the European Parliament it 's clear that this is a political question .","label":1}
{"sentence":"and to be lectured on the need for Europe to reform labour markets and increase employment by a Chancellor who has presided over record levels of unemployment in Germany , really takes the biscuit .","label":0}

{"sentence":"we need to continue together with the Commissioner the task of creating a true single market for consumers .","label":0}

{"sentence":"however , I voted in favour of this report on a common immigration policy , but with an extremely heavy heart .","label":0}
{"sentence":"work must once again be rewarded in Europe .","label":1}
{"sentence":"European Union will finalize its stance on this matter at European Council meeting in Seville .","label":1}

{"sentence":"all facts , Mr President , I already warned as rapporteur back in 1996 in my identical initiative report and appealed urgently not to let it happen again like in 1994 leading to another delay of the start of this new planning period .","label":1}
{"sentence":"characteristically there was significant government failure ; mistakes were not addressed until too late and decisions or prohibitions made were not adequately monitored when they should have been .","label":1}

{"sentence":"firstly , Socrates is an essential and decisive European program as it educates people across Europe and serves as the European answer for educational prospects of tomorrow .","label":1}
{"sentence":"in India for instance , companies are marketing a drug for the treatment of that drug-resistant diarrhoea , at 1.8 % of the price charged in Pakistan where only the patented version can be bought .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I repeat that unless I can give those guarantees to the budgetary authority it would be very difficult to persuade people to make the budgetary switches which will be required in order to achieve a reasonable level of generosity within the bounds laid down in the financial perspective .","label":0}
{"sentence":"there is normally considerable lobbying at this final stage , but not on this occasion .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the European Community \u2019 s prime role is to ensure a framework which enables and encourages stakeholders and authorities at all levels to optimise and realise the tourism sector \u2019 s potential for growth and employment .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , is there any political institution before which we could talk more openly and sincerely about the historic wishes and political aspirations of a small European people than the European Parliament ?","label":0}
{"sentence":"naturally , I welcome the fact \u2013 though I do not think his speech was quite so enthusiastic \u2013 that Mr Valdivielso 's report is generally supportive of the Commission 's efforts to reform the MEDA Regulation , though there are some criticisms .","label":0}
{"sentence":"therefore I would welcome it if for example the newly elected Mexican President also pays Europe a visit soon \u2013 perhaps even here in Parliament \u2013 and if European heads of state were to pay Mexico a visit as well .","label":1}

{"sentence":"these include missions to Brazil and Thailand .","label":0}
{"sentence":"inter-state and , more recently , inter-regional alliances both within the European Union and with partners outside is an initiative we can pride ourselves on developing enthusiastically .","label":0}

{"sentence":"the current Community legislation should , if rigorously implemented , be sufficient to prevent new animals from becoming infected .","label":0}
{"sentence":"after two years of implementation it should not only be evaluated how widespread its application has become but also whether goals have been achieved and this will certainly be very important given that here we are dealing solely with tests .","label":1}

{"sentence":"however it 's not only a pure hobby but Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union explicitly foresees this common economic policy and coordinated economy and finance policies .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I hope at that meeting , where amongst other issues they will be talking about the Atypical Workers Directive , the Commission will take the opportunity to show that it wants to promote a different message and not the same old messages that have been promoted in the past and that it too believes in entrepreneurship and flexibility and does not wish to remain mired in the past .","label":0}

{"sentence":"we will have to find many different ways \u2013 perhaps unexpected ways \u2013 of solving the logistical problems of getting assistance to the people who need it , but it is difficult to promise specific action on this one .","label":0}
{"sentence":"on the contrary , the acceleration of the enlargement negotiations should help in that respect .","label":0}
{"sentence":"applicants should also be encouraged to participate in Community programs for equality of opportunity , especially those dealing with violence against women .","label":1}

{"sentence":"support for it would therefore damage the trust and credibility the EU has earned with its projects and in its relations with local communities .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the information which will be provided , which was a vade mecum in this report , to small businesses and which they now have a right to be informed about , will go a long way in helping to change the culture in the workplace .","label":0}

{"sentence":"it is yet another tragic demonstration that the vocation of protecting the profits of capitalist groups is incompatible with effective defence of the interests of the majority of the population .","label":0}
