{"sentence":"this is a topical debate .","label":0}

{"sentence":"the foolish arguments of those who want to reduce the five-day week of the European Parliament in Strasbourg to four days , preferably faithful to their salamit tactics , on Monday and not here , are clearly aimed at destroying the seat of Strasbourg for 12 plenary meetings a year and thus also to move the seat of the General Secretariat of the European Parliament from Luxembourg to Brussels .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the consumer policy budget must and will be executed in strict accordance with the rules set out in the Financial Regulation .","label":0}

{"sentence":"for this reason IPP is a key measure within the Sixth Environment Action Programme and the Sustainable Development Strategy also underlines its importance .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I think that right now , when we already have traces in certain industries that have their reason in the fact that too little has been educated and re-educated , such a national right to further education would be the command of the hour .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the proposal regulates the preparation , characteristics and schedule for the transmission of the quarterly data on the financial costs of each Member State .","label":1}
{"sentence":"there are enough reports .","label":1}
{"sentence":"in the end , I think , there should be a regulation that promotes the integration of the Latin American continent and also takes into account the historically growing European-Latin American relations .","label":1}
{"sentence":"before the end of the year , the Commission intends to adopt an ambitious scholarship programme so that postgraduate Latin American students can complete their studies in Europe .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I also would like to point out that not only the Alps , but above all the Nordic regions , the Polar regions , but also the southern regions have their special requirements .","label":1}
{"sentence":"there is no possible justification for such acts .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I think this is the first question to be answered .","label":1}
{"sentence":"firstly , it is a great pleasure to have the Commissioner here .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I have two questions .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I think you have not said anything about that yet .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the Commission considers that a high level of democratic stability has been achieved in the future Member States , that human rights are respected in the future Member States , including freedom of religion .","label":1}
{"sentence":"that means that we must reprimand corruption and red-tape efficiently and firmly , and give to the public servant a professional status that should no longer be used to reward political clients .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I have no doubt that better public transport has a vital part to play in this transport strategy .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we overcome a crisis not by stop , but by movement .","label":1}
{"sentence":"but over the last year there have been a number of developments which actually cause me and many others to doubt the commitment of the Commission .","label":0}
{"sentence":"at the same time , the Commission strongly urges those responsible for the organization of the hunger strike to take away from all actions and demands that may lead to further loss of human lives .","label":1}
{"sentence":"therefore , it is necessary to put on a higher investment level .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the Serbian and federal authorities have indicated their intention to urgently re-examine the cases of those not covered by the law , particularly to ascertain whether the convictions are sound or not .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I can say to the President of the Council :","label":1}
{"sentence":"in similar vein , its Amendment 19 to Article 2 ( 1 ) , proposes to delete the limiting phrase ' for application to the human body ' , thus opening the directive 's full provisions to in vitro research in laboratories , or even school rooms , where no application to the human body is involved .","label":0}
{"sentence":"that is , request 9 refers to point 19 , namely to the abolition of the second part of the paragraph .","label":1}
{"sentence":"however , I would like to point out that there is a fairly interesting request from colleague Zappal\u00e0 , by means of a compromise \u2013 that is the amendment request 147 \u2013 for the event that a boost of the threshold values should be decided , to ensure that the basic principles of this Directive apply also to all fees below that threshold .","label":1}
{"sentence":"these investments are necessary .","label":1}
{"sentence":"once the expansion is completed , new funds are also provided for the administration .","label":1}
{"sentence":"it is vital that this and other such regions are fully and properly borne in mind when policies are developed dealing with these matters .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this was not a nice picture , there are two sides responsible who demanded that , but also the government in Belgrade , which was first too hesitant .","label":1}
{"sentence":"they demand that , and the European Parliament is to renew its support .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I do not follow the conclusions of the Commission in full , and I have made it clear in my report :","label":1}
{"sentence":"this is now happening with the new arrangement of the budget , and it is recognizable with a look at how much to be spent on which policy areas .","label":1}
{"sentence":"finally , the Commission played an active role in the UN General Assembly special session on children .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Jerusalem is the key issue and it needs to be looked at in a new light .","label":0}
{"sentence":"that \u2019 s why I \u2019 m glad for the compromise , but now I ask you if you , apart from those who are the winners of this compromise for the most diverse reasons \u2013 young athletes , small clubs , big clubs \u2013 do not fear that this compromise with its different treatment of athletes up to 28 and above , this breach of the principle of equality could not result in that there will be even more \u201c Bosmans \u201d at the end , that is , that the ordinary courts represent a different opinion about it than this compromise .","label":1}
{"sentence":"there is a fine difference .","label":1}
{"sentence":"neither of the two proposed amendments falls , in my view , into these categories .","label":0}
{"sentence":"meanwhile , I would just like to highlight three points from the report : paragraph 13 where we would like to see in next year the Commission report much more concrete evidence of the employment gains that this multiannual programme has produced , not because we doubt what those employment gains might be , but we would like to see some hard data next time around .","label":0}
{"sentence":"and as there is one , as you would call it , public hystery , there is an immediate fear of the breakdown of the beef markets .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the history of this project means , however , that the Commission considers that certainty about the realistic hand-over date can only be established when a specific date has been fixed in a contract that will also make provision for financial penalties for late delivery .","label":0}
{"sentence":"without any committee , without any commission , it would have been very easy , for example , to abolish article 312 of the Criminal Code \u2013 it would only require a vote in the great Turkish National Assembly \u2013 and thus a whole set of intellectuals , writers , journalists and the same Akin Birdal would be released from prison .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I want to ask if the Commission could not take an initiative .","label":1}
{"sentence":"one of the worst offenders in this connection is the UK .","label":0}
{"sentence":"secondly , we must continue to criticise China .","label":0}
{"sentence":"according to the Commission , additional trade preferences should be considered within the framework of the general preference system for countries that effectively implement these standards .","label":1}
{"sentence":"however , the Commission also clearly expresses its preferences , which form a coherent system .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we want the freedom to say what we don \u2019 t like elsewhere , and we also urge our friends to say what they don \u2019 t like .","label":1}
{"sentence":"in Europe we can perhaps afford the luxury of denying ourselves the food productivity benefits which GM crops offer , but do our Green colleagues not consider the interests of their fellow human beings in sub-Saharan Africa or East Asia to whom GM crops will bring nutrition and health benefits and may even help them survive ?","label":0}
{"sentence":"is regulation of food additives a matter of competition or consumer policy ?","label":1}
{"sentence":"we associate this with a clear attitude of expectation for the future , which has to do with the enforcement of law and law in all parts of the country .","label":1}
{"sentence":"in Kyoto , the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 8 % .","label":1}
{"sentence":"but how can we compromise , how can we find a way out between two radically different solutions ?","label":0}
{"sentence":"we must also be able to act in a European Union if there should be a government that is exercising the total blockade .","label":1}
{"sentence":"in that context we join with the rapporteur in feeling that some kind of special provisions concerning subsidies are merited as long as those market distorting subsidies continue elsewhere .","label":0}
{"sentence":"by extending this regulation today for a further period of one year , we are also giving the Commission time to prepare a new regulation which I hope will be a multiannual one to replace the existing regulation .","label":0}
{"sentence":"if the definition is too wide \u2013 as it is proposed , it would cover , in some cases , the whole biosphere \u2013 it will be unmanageable .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the second problem we have here is the following :","label":1}
{"sentence":"our experts will begin this work on Friday .","label":0}
{"sentence":"they could include the method of appointment of principal officials : should they be political appointments or civil servants , and how they should be held accountable by elected representatives ?","label":0}
{"sentence":"\u201c There is too little money . \u201d","label":1}
{"sentence":"this is an increase compared to before .","label":1}
{"sentence":"Mr President !","label":1}
{"sentence":"however , to achieve all of that we have to build confidence in our consumers .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this is a difficult debate .","label":0}
{"sentence":"then we have to work on concrete indicators .","label":0}
{"sentence":"he does not dismiss the responsible person from taking his specific responsibility .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I hope that the Commission will not forget that .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Mr. Pirker 's important report must follow what we have voted now , although we had proposed something different this morning , according to the normal procedure now to be voted this afternoon or tomorrow early .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I suppose in a way it was worth waiting .","label":0}
{"sentence":"because Mr Fischler is here , I would like to say that EU agricultural subsidies are killing the poor farmers in the Third World .","label":0}
{"sentence":"as deputy chairman of the Lithuanian delegation , I would like to focus on this country and in the context on the Ignalina nuclear power plant .","label":1}
{"sentence":"there is one on this issue .","label":0}
{"sentence":"one further vote of thanks is also due , and that is actually to a ghost of this Chamber : that is , to my former colleague and good friend Lyndon Harrison , who was rapporteur at first reading , now Lord Harrison of Chester .","label":0}
{"sentence":"we have proposed in our budget suggestion for next year that it should receive EUR 5 million .","label":0}
{"sentence":"it is intended to provide a special report on the role of the regions .","label":1}
{"sentence":"my group recommends the Commission to submit a new proposal and calls for a rejection of the proposal .","label":1}
{"sentence":"so the ties that bind Scotland and Canada are much stronger , I would argue , than the ties that bind the United Kingdom and the United States of America .","label":0}
{"sentence":"however , it is clear that the question of the deputy is now concerned not only in the narrow sense with the payment settlements , but also with the question of the amount of liabilities to be fulfilled from previous financial years in total .","label":1}
{"sentence":"we need to have women stronger in social functions not only here , but also in the partner countries , and the European Union \u2013 I emphasize this again \u2013 must focus its tools of cooperation even more on women , in the sense that if we , through the program of democracy , allow women the empowerment , open the dialogue , this is for the benefit of us all .","label":1}
{"sentence":"however , from the present facts alone , I lack any faith in it .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the High House has submitted several requests regarding the security of the foreign representation , but of course also regarding all aid for Afghanistan .","label":1}
{"sentence":"a meeting between the Patriarch and the Venerable Thich Quang Do , another prominent leader of the Unified Buddhist Church , has also been authorised .","label":0}
{"sentence":"I know he is extremely proud of being the rapporteur for the Marco Polo Programme and is looking forward to its passing through Parliament later this week .","label":0}
{"sentence":"there must be a European defence .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the amendments proposed in 3 , 4 , 23 , 24 , 31 and 56 shall ensure that the scope of the basic quotas and the amount of the supposed maximum supply needs of the refining industry are unchanged .","label":1}
{"sentence":"but in order to equal competition , the Parliament has demanded that we do not promote the area of superstructure , but that the infrastructure be promoted to the maximum .","label":1}
{"sentence":"however , this contradiction will hardly be explained to the citizens .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I have no desire to add anything to the current debate .","label":0}
{"sentence":"as we have emphasized in the White Paper , it is necessary to improve the standards of the European government for the collection and use of expertise .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I would like to pick out a few concrete examples .","label":0}
{"sentence":"it is about my constituent , Mark Forrester , who was arrested on alleged football hooliganism during the EURO 2000 championships .","label":0}
{"sentence":"human life is not created by third parties .","label":1}
{"sentence":"the crisis of the past few years has increased awareness for all of us .","label":1}
{"sentence":"this is the first of our efforts in the coming months and years , and that must also remain our efforts beyond the next European elections with the new colleagues here in the European Parliament !","label":1}
{"sentence":"the Council urges , the Parliament urges .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs. Haug , for her very interesting combination of absolute determination and great negotiation willingness , which has led to this good outcome .","label":1}
{"sentence":"above all , we should only seek to regulate and influence at a European level that which is of transeuropean concern .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the Commission would prefer , therefore , to stick to what has previously been agreed .","label":0}
{"sentence":"President Bush \u2019 s announcement of the supply of $ 5 billion , which was then further increased over the week to get closer to the EU \u2019 s position , witnesses a reflection also in the U.S. development policy , whose status has been constantly shortened over the past 20 years .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I think it is an important message that the Italian Council Presidency has expressed the same and that there may be a constructive cooperation between Parliament and the Italian Council Presidency in the framework of the government conference .","label":1}
{"sentence":"I would particularly recommend paragraphs 22 and 23 , on this concerning the mutual recognition of national cards carried by people with disabilities .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the EU \u2019 s objectives on energy were addressed in the Council Presidency Conclusions of 30 May 2002 , in which the EU reaffirmed its commitment to facilitating the achievement of the millennium development goal of halving the number of people in extreme poverty , and other millennium development goals , by 2015 , through the provision of adequate , affordable and sustainable energy services .","label":0}
{"sentence":"first , the report shows that there is no common methodology to calculate the air noise , and second , there is no common methodology to monitor the output data .","label":1}
{"sentence":"all those things in Europe are completely public and it just requires an official of the Commission to look into it and do some studies on it and then publish it .","label":0}
{"sentence":"the second issue concerns freedom of dealers and their ability to invest .","label":0}
{"sentence":"if we are truly to bring about the idea of the single market , and if we are truly to live up to the principles of the freedom of movement of persons , than we must dismantle these barriers , which we can see are not so much at a European Union institution level but are actually at Member State level and indeed in some Member States at the level of certain individual professions .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Mrs. President , Mrs. President of the Council !","label":1}

{"sentence":"finally , on the European Medicines Evaluation Agency , our proposal follows the lines which were provided for the European Food Safety Authority at the time of our proposal .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this is the case , and as a rapporteur , you must , of course , express the opinion of the committee .","label":1}
{"sentence":"if the title is modified to clarify that the proposal is concerned only with illegal trafficking , then reproductive and embryonic organs and tissues and blood should also be included in the scope of the proposal .","label":0}
{"sentence":"this has led to the budgetary rights of the Parliament .","label":1}
{"sentence":"another resolution , this time of July 2001 , recommended the adoption of a Fifth Motor Insurance Directive very much along the lines of the current Commission proposal .","label":0}
{"sentence":"Mr President , I would just like to endorse everything that Mr Howitt has said .","label":0}
