Commissioner , I thank you for your urgency in this matter .
together we are on the right path .
the goal is known , but we still have a lot of steps to take .
this brings me to some of the points of discussion .
firstly , the concept of subsidiarity .
I am a fervent supporter of the principle of subsidiarity and come from a country which
I would also like to call on all Member States not to use the principle of subsidiarity

I thought this was very important .

I have been in contact with President Prodi in recent days and , on behalf of our

we will be very keen to discuss this with the Council in the coming days and weeks .
we will be paying close attention to how open and open-minded the Council is with

everyone must know that cooperation means that everyone is willing to talk to each other .
this is also the case in connection with the supplementary and amending budget , as always in
we are ready , but we are also ready to discuss with each other very intensively and ,
I came directly here to Strasbourg last night from a visit to Israel .
maybe my statements are somewhat influenced by my private connections .
but believe me , this people wants peace on both sides .
it is part of our task to be able to talk to both sides .
it does not always have to be exclusively the politicians who are now active .
we agree with the resolution of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , where
Nice has of course both bright and dark sides , but very many shadow sides .
but our benchmark for Nice has always been the European Union 's capacity to act .

it is always the case that there is never enough in culture , never enough in education .

what we find here is not enough to meet the audiovisual revolution .
nor is it enough to develop a genuine European audiovisual policy vis-à-vis

it is a question of better coordinating these measures .
hence the request that it be finally implemented .
I would like to give you three reasons for this :
firstly , political responsibility must also be assumed by each individual .
each Commissioner is responsible and accountable for his or her department .
not all candidates see this in this way .
secondly , there are still doubts about the Commissioner-designate for research .
I am waiting for you , Mr Prodi , to make a further statement on this .
thirdly , the re-candidacy of former Commissioners ultimately leaves the question
I believe that the application of the new regulation on the conservation of fisheries resources through

that is very unfortunate .

I believe that it is really necessary - and I have also said this in the Commission -
it is important that we also give small-scale fishing a future .
the second point concerns the Convention .
we must have the courage to decide on certain issues in foreign and security policy by majority vote
if everything remains unanimous , we will not be able to reach common positions ,
the social dimension of the European Union , a prerequisite for European democracy , is also
on the issue of foreign and security policy , this report wastes a great deal of time

on this basis , we support the vote on Thursday , i.e. today , so that

at the same time , however , we must stick to the facts .
the fact is that the European Commission and the Central Bank have presented us with reports .
both reports have said – the European Central Bank ’ s perhaps with some more reservations

if you are to draw up such a noise map only for 6 million cars a year

the question arises , what role can a specialised committee play if the Committee on Budgets
what role are the technical committees supposed to play then ?
I am afraid that legal protection in this European Union will be further restricted .
it is only clear who is responsible for this .

it is essential that international aid is well coordinated .
the Commission must set up its own appropriate structures on the ground .
it must also cooperate with the international organisations which have been working on the ground for many
I would therefore like to ask you and the Commission to cooperate accordingly , not only

what we are doing here is actually regulated deregulation , if that were not a bad

we are not only opening up the market for gas and electricity , but we are also setting conditions

I therefore believe that we need an answer to the following questions .
firstly , does the European Union need its own nut production ?
secondly , do nuts play a multifunctional role ?
thirdly , should the EU continue to invest in the preservation of nut production ?
fourthly , if so , in what form ?
the coasts are not urban areas , but today about one third of the EU population lives in

we must therefore do something for the coasts of Europe .
our Parliament has made a number of proposals to the Commission over the years and is now waiting

then we will get back together again , and we will have fun again .
politics is not a dirty business , it is a lot of fun !
I would also like to mention tobacco cultivation in the Union .
subsidies for tobacco cultivation are structural aid .
they are to be abolished without any alternative for the farmers .
80 % of the tobacco needs are already being imported .
so when we talk about abolishing subsidies , we must think globally , otherwise only
jobs were lost , cultural landscapes were devastated .
but that would not mean less smoking .
international regulations must be pursued in this area .

what is the point of building an area of security , freedom and justice ?
it is about security and fundamental rights , i.e. direct individual rights on the one hand

there is therefore a direct link with almost all issues , whether it is asylum ,

above all , it overcomes borders , including the borders of the European Union
even without kerosene taxation , airports within the EU are already in enormous competition with
this is mainly due to different regional night flight regulations , which affect freight traffic in
the price pressure on airlines is enormous for this reason alone .
if we were to impose taxes on aviation fuel in Europe on our own ,
we would be destroying this European market ourselves .
therefore , the taxation of kerosene can only be implemented with international consensus in
Europe must work towards this , even though it will be a difficult and long road .
until then , however , there are certainly other ways of regulating , for example ,
this would affect all airlines , European and non-European .
it would be neutral to competition .

we have now decided in Parliament to set up this committee for NATO .

I see the restructuring of premiums as one of the most important points .
the introduction of a flat-rate premium is a major step forward .

the current high euro exchange rate should be a sign that the European economy is actually doing well .
we all know that this is not really the case .
we are not really doing well , we have lived above our means in the last decades

the consequence of this is that those who are willing and capable are burdened with tasks

Mr President , our public pension systems are too expensive and no longer sustainable .
the gap between active workers and pensioners is growing ever wider .
urgent reforms are being delayed time and again .
the costs of these systems also vary greatly within the Union .
Austria , for example , spends 15 % of its gross domestic product on pensions
the high costs in Austria , for example , can be partly attributed to the fact that
this leads to a series of injustices that are no longer desirable .
but as I have already said , not only in Austria , but throughout Europe , pension insurance is
a major step forward in this legislation – and this has been forgotten time and time
for this reason , we want to keep this statute unchanged .

let me say something about these three points .
firstly , we are planning financial increases for political priorities for the cross-border programme
the new external borders of the European Union need greater support for cooperation across these border

this is also a priority for this Parliament , and we want to see this reflected in
Madam President , I made this statement on behalf of Mr von Boetticher , who had

I understand your concern about small-scale fisheries and it is true that these smaller

we have absolutely the same view here .
I agree that we must do everything possible to ensure that this small-scale coastal fishing
this is the only way to ensure that all aid not covered by the Code is strict
a Council regulation which is directly applicable law must also be respected by the regional governments
distortions of competitive conditions and market imbalance must also be avoided in the future .
I know that this is a difficult debate , because it is about the acquis .
however , this also involves a fundamental question , namely the question of what solidarity means
I now come to the point .
for us , it is completely unacceptable to lift the de facto moratorium , because very
I also find it unacceptable what is happening here .
we have the Scheele report , we have had a debate on the de facto moratorium .
we have also discussed the Fiori report very broadly and in detail , in which it

it is clear that they do not want to accept that what has long been demanded in other

if we really want to help them , we must work to change the economic framework .
this means that our administrative systems and laws need to be modernised and simplified .

these measures must be safeguarded by adding limits on administrative expenditure to
but I would first like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Cornillet , for his report

we have already talked about it .
it is quite right to draw this report on the Charter of Fundamental Rights .

we agree on that .

there is no question that the waste equipment must be managed by the companies currently on the market

I believe that we have taken a good step here , too .

Mrs Carlotti has just referred to many of the recommendations in the report .

Mr Corrie has done very good work in this regard in recent years as co-chair .
the result is an ambitious agreement that opens up new horizons in cooperation

however , Mr Savary , the task of the universal service is to offer typical postal services
the task of the universal service is not to organize citizen care and psychological counselling
in order to make universal service possible , we are reserving a space for monopolies .
that means that we deliberately exclude competition for the exceptional purpose .
but the exclusion must only apply to postal services and not to public services , social services or
we cannot find any legal basis for excluding competition .

Parliament has repeatedly insisted that this must be done and that all problems must be address

but the political developments and violent clashes have again raised barriers .
in some cases , the blockades in the Gaza Strip even prevent the delivery of equipment and the
a large part of the staff cannot get to the hospital at the moment .
we must repeatedly call for an end to the violence , including in this debate .
the European taxpayer was prepared to provide assistance to the people of the Gaza Strip .
now , at last , this aid should be used by the population .
allow me to make one more point on Category VII , Mr President .
I would like to point out that it is in fact unacceptable that the aid programme

most of those who have been involved in the directive so far are lawyers .

Mr President , this Supplementary and Amending Budget 5 / 99 is an important step
I am pleased that this time the expert recommendations of the OLAF Supervisory Committee
as we have heard , this has not always been the case .
this has been corrected and that is good for OLAF .
it underlines our desire to ensure OLAF 's independence .
the decision on filling these posts will be made by the future Director of OLAF .
that is why the third point is essential , it is an essential part of what we are put
the setting of an ambitious timetable for full market opening .
the timetable that we have now set together with the Council is ambitious , and if
Austria cannot deal with the problem of the entire zone alone .
one can be divided about the ecopoints .
they were an instrument .
one can accuse Austria of not having done its homework , of not having sought and
his activities were perhaps a little too sparse , the capacities of the railroad

it shows clearly that the main objectives of the 1999 reform of

thirdly , the approach of decentralising the day-to-day management of the

in other words , we will have a common energy policy by the detour of environmental policy .
in 2005 we could start this emissions trading within the European Union .
again , I hope that this scenario will be more or less adhered to and that we
in this sense , we should support the Commission and also be as united as possible .
I would like to point out one aspect in this context , namely that the great country of
dialogue between cultures , especially between the United States of America and the Islamic world , sometimes
I think we have a great potential if France in particular , together with Canada , promotes this
Canada can be a mediator between the US and the Islamic world .
this is not least in the interests of our most important partner , namely the United States
these companies are usually poorly equipped with equity capital .
the construction , tourism and catering sectors are particularly affected .
the equity ratio of the catering industry in Austria , for example , is only 1
however , since the equity ratio is supposed to be decisive for granting credit in
the consequences would be catastrophic .
the companies would no longer be able to invest and modernize and would have to close .
we would lose thousands , if not thousands , of businesses and jobs .
I can only agree with the rapporteur when he calls for an analysis of these effects , so

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission continues to pay great attention to the
current and future work , in particular the study by the Directorate-General for Regional Policy ,
what we must do now , however , is to press for the rapid implementation of all these
I would also like to take this opportunity to point out what has developed less positively .
that is usually the working situation in this House .
cooperation with the Council leaves much to be desired .
documents are increasingly being submitted too late or not at all , which then leads
the Council often shines through its absence at important committee meetings , but also in plena
an example is Monday , when we met in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights
the Council was absent , and there was no written information for discussion .
this is unacceptable , to say the least , in terms of the cooperation situation here

however , they can also be a source of prosperity for people and regions if the change is

in this sense , we have every reason to thank the Commission for its course .

I would like to make two comments on two points , with two requests .

and if we look at the case of Leyla Zana :

I am in favour of having a referendum on the Constitution in all our Member States .
I would like to point out to all of you that there is an initiative in this regard
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work .
the report mainly focuses on the essential points and fits well into existing legislation
however , allow me to make a general comment at this point on the formal structure of the report
I wonder whether the technical criteria listed in the annex should really be discussed by

I will say something about it in a moment .
as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , I would like to make one further point
we have voted on Amendment No 3 .
there was an oral amendment that was agreed with the Commission .
I will not go into details now , but this was not included in the report .
I would like to put on record my wish that this be clarified and that we then have

I remember the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta .

that was denied them at the time .
I hope that this will not happen again in Athens , dear Anne Karamanou .
the Heads of State or Government will have a chance to do so at the next Council in

secondly , in the context of budgetary policy , we are currently dealing with countries that
what programs do you think could be used to get the problems under control again ?
Mr President , Commissioner , this storm at the turn of the millennium is basically me

natural disasters have always existed and will continue to exist .
of course , solidarity is needed in this context .

at least you do not say how you intend to achieve this .
secondly , you say hardly anything about how this is to be done together with Parliament .

I hope that after the elections on Sunday in Austria we will have a government that places the common
Mr President , I agree with the rapporteur on the main points and , in the short time
what we need first of all is coherent , homogeneous legislation at European Union level .
this is often not the case because terms are used that have a different meaning in other legal text
in general , this Community law is hardly researched scientifically in this sense .
that is why you should first ensure coherence and homogeneity in your own legal text
that is one aspect .
I should therefore like to express my special thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur
unlike the discharge procedure for the Commission , we do not have to complain that we
we may have received some a little late , but we have received them all .
this is also a difference from the discharge procedure .

the truth is that we have incorporated a whole series of new measures into this agreement

it is therefore not the case that we simply continue to fish the maximum quantity regardless

the proof of the contrary can only be taken in years .

I should like to say briefly that the Commission accepts Amendment No 2,
in my view , the concern expressed in Amendment No 3 has now turned out
this is of course a matter of experience .
perhaps at some point , we will come to the conclusion that it should be mandatory ;

I believe that this will also facilitate the implementation of this reform .
